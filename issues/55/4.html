This issue we're doing something a bit differently.  Normally, this file is
reserved for the Phrack Prophile.  However, this issue, we are instead paying
homage to a recently deceased esteemed member of the upper echelon of the
computer elite.  This is our little way of providing a tribute to the most
widely read TCP/IP author in history.  

I first read Stevens in 1992.  I still have that first edition UNIX Network
Programming book sitting on my shelf.  I learned a great deal from that book,
but that was nothing compared to how much the TCP/IP Illustrated series taught
me...  I remember getting vol. I in 1994..  I still have that one too, all
marked up with highlighters and whatnot...  Before I knew it, I found myself 
firmly immersed in IP networks (I even read vol. II from cover to cover).
I know I have Stevens to thank for sparking that interest in me.  His death
is a great loss.

There is also another reason why W. Richard Stevens is featured here -- he was
to be the prophile for Phrack 55.

I sent Richard email initially on August 31st asking him if he would have
time to be profiled for Phrack 55.  To my great delight (and somewhat suprise)
he agreed!  I emailed him the template, and sent him a follow-up email...
The last I heard from him was on September 1st, telling me that he was
pretty busy and needed some time to look it over.  Sadly this is also the
day he died.  These emails will not appear here out of respect for Stevens
and his family.  Instead, republished here is a copy of his obiturary from
www.bigdealclassifieds.com.

STEVENS, W. Richard, noted author of computer books died on September 1.
He is best known for his ``UNIX Network Programming'' series (1990, 1998,
1999),  ``Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment'' (1992), and ``TCP/IP
Illustrated'' series (1994, 1995, 1996).  Richard was born in 1951 in Luanshya,
Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where his father worked for the copper
industry.  The family moved to Salt Lake City, Hurley, New Mexico, Washington,
DC and Phalaborwa, South Africa. Richard attended Fishburne Military School in
Waynesboro, Virginia. He received a B.SC. in Aerospace Engineering from the
University of Michigan in 1973, and an M.S. (1978) and Ph.D. (1982) in Systems
Engineering from the University of Arizona.  He moved to Tucson in 1975 and
from then until 1982 he was employed at Kitt Peak National Observatory as a
computer programmer.  From 1982 until 1990 he was Vice President of Computing
Services at Health Systems International in New Haven, CT, moving back to
Tucson in 1990. Here he pursued his career as an author and consultant.  He
was also an avid pilot and a part-time flight instructor during the 1970's.
He is survived by his loving wife of 20 years, Sally Hodges Stevens; three
wonderful children, Bill, Ellen and David; sister, Claire Stevens of Las Vegas,
NV; brother, Bob and wife Linda Stevens of Dallas, TX; nieces, Laura, Sarah,
Collette, Christy; and nephew, Brad. He is predeceased by his parents, Royale
J. Stevens (1915-1984); and Helen Patterson Stevens (1916-1997).  Helen lived
in Tucson from 1991-1997, and Royale lived here in the early 1930's attending
Tucson High School while his father was treated for TB at the Desert
Sanitorium (now TMC).  The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations
be made in Richard's name to Habitat for Humanity, 2950 E. 22nd Street,
Tucson, AZ 85713.
