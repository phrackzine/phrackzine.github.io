5. SkyTel 2-Way Pagers.

Imagine the freedom of getting a question and pushing one button to 
answer... from a pager small enough to fit in your hand. Your callers
get answers quickly and easily by telephone, computer, e-mail or even
on their SkyTel pager. And you reduce long-distance and cellular phone
expenses!

SkyTel 2-Way is the first and only service that allows you to respond to
a message from a pager.

The SkyTel 2-Way System acts as the clearinghouse for all outgoing and
incoming messages.

Messages to you:
People sending you messages (senders) can do so by:

   - phone (numeric, voice messages, or operator-assisted text messages)
   - computer (SkyTel Access or QuickAccess software, e-mail, or palmtop
     computer connection)

Messages from you:
And senders can get your response via:

   - phone
   - computer
   - SkyWord or SkyTel 2-Way pagers

Works with Other SkyTel Services:

SkyTalk: Full-featured voice mail lets senders leave a detailed message
         and then you call back to hear the reply.
SkyNews: Headline news provided twice daily.

The answer is in the palm of your hand With SkyTel 2-Way, your senders
become your partners in communications. They compose messages with
multiple-choice responses for you to choose from, such as:

   - CLIENT WILL SIGN $80K CONTRACT IF WE CAN DELIVER BY 4/7
   - PROCEED
   - DO NOT PROCEED
   - AWAIT MY CALL

Or if your sender does not define responses, select from one of your SkyTel
2-Way pager's 16 pre-programmed responses:

   - YES/OK
   - NO
   - WILL CALL LATER
   - CALL ME
   - RUNNING LATE
   - NEED MORE INFO
   - SEND # TO CALL
   - WHERE ARE YOU?
   - WILL ARRIVE 15M
   - WILL ARRIVE 30M
   - TRAFFIC DELAY
   - PICK ME UP
   - BUSY
   - FINISHED
   - CALL HOME

Senders can receive your response at their convenience, 24 hours a day by
phone, PC or SkyTel pager.

7. SkyTel SkyFax Option.

Whoever invented the fax machine apparently didn't know much about doing
business on the road. After all, you can't take the machine with you. It
has very little interest in your schedule. And critical faxes have a way of
arriving at the wrong place, and the wrong time.

SkyFax Features:

   - You are assigned a personal toll-free number that people use to send
     you faxes.
   - Notification on your SkyPager or SkyWord pager that a fax has
     arrived in your mailbox.
   - Dial a toll-free number to download the fax to fax machine of your
     choice.
   - SkyFax even works with your portable computer's send/receive fax
     software.

SkyFax Benefits:

SkyFax offers total control over how and where people reach you with
important fax messages.

   - Toll-free number reduces long-distance charges.
   - Download faxes at YOUR convenience.
   - Senders don't have to know your travel schedule in order to send you
     faxes -- you'll never miss an important fax.
   - Your documents remain confidential, because you're in control.

8. SkyTel SkyTalk Option.

Now, when you travel, The SkyTel System will let you give the people who
need to stay in touch with you one toll-free phone number where you can
always be reached. Even if they don't know exactly where you are, they'll
be able to call a single number and leave a voice message in your SkyTalk(r)
voice mailbox. You'll be notified quickly that a message is waiting. Then
you can retrieve it whenever you want.

SkyTalk can also be used to send information to a whole group of people
simultaneously with one phone call. Even if they're spread across Phoenix,
Los Angeles, Boston and Miami, everyone will be notified in minutes.

SkyTalk Features

   - SkyTalk is an easily-accessible toll-free voice mail system that
     notifies you when you have a message on your SkyPager, SkyWord or
     SkyTel 2-Way pager.
   - Personal toll-free access numbers are available to provide callers
     with easy access to your voice mail. You can even forward your office
     number to your toll-free Personal Access Number when you're traveling
     so every caller can leave a message for you.
   - You can access other parts of The SkyTel System easily, without
     hanging up the phone. For example, you can reply directly to messages
     from other subscribers, broadcast messages to a subscriber list and
     redirect messages to other subscribers.

Additional SkyTalk Features

   - Personalized voice mail greeting -- your own words in your own voice.
   - Security code to prevent unauthorized access.

12. SkyTel accessible by Land, Sea or Air.

     Accessibility is important in any business, but when you provide
     mobile satellite communications to maritime, aeronautical and
     land mobile customers, it's your main selling point.

     The folks at COMSAT Mobile Communications sell communications
     that know no bounds, so they need to keep in constant contact
     with all their customers and prospects. That's why they rely on
     SkyTel.

     Robert Katz, director of Mobile Data for COMSAT, says, &quot;It's not
     just SkyTel paging that's so valuable to us. It's the whole
     spectrum of SkyTel services.&quot; As a matter of fact, the company
     depends on more than 160 SkyTel pagers, especially in the sales,
     engineering and operations divisions, as well as a variety of
     SkyTel services.

     Serving as much-needed administrative support, a SkyTel Corporate
     Access Number gives customers or employees toll-free access to
     sending pages - with just one easy number and without having to
     carry or remember PlNs. With a list of key COMSAT employees and
     their PlNs, the SkyTel operator sends messages like a personal
     assistant. Katz uses this service to send out important meeting
     notices or project reminders, either to individuals or an entire
     group. &quot;It's even better than voice mail or e-mail,&quot; says Katz.

     SkyTel service even works with COMSAT's office systems to keep
     communications transparent to the caller. For example, when Katz
     receives a call at his desk, his office voice mail system pages
     him immediately. Wherever he is, his SkyTel pager alerts him that
     a call is waiting. Within minutes, he phones in an access code to
     be connected instantly. When he picks up the call, the caller
     doesn't know if Katz is in a meeting, driving down the highway or
     relaxing at home. All he knows is that Katz is available for him.

     A loyal SkyTel customer since 1990, COMSAT is currently
     integrating SkyTel 2-Way messaging into their day-to-day
     operations. Of course, you would fully expect these experts in
     satellite communications to take advantage of the best in
     satellite messaging technology. With SkyTel they're moving full
     speed ahead.

14. Getting Phree SkyTel Pagers

    To get phree SkyTel pagers you will need to get a pin. To do this
    you will have to do some scanning. Use the prefixes in section 16 of
    this article. Each pin is seven digits. If an account has a personal
    800 number, then that is the pin. For example 800-759-9826. The pin
    is 7599826.

    Hint: If you find a pin with option 3# on it. Which is alpha-numeric
          paging. Call it up. The SkyTel operator will read you the name
          of the owner of the pager. Now you have the owner. All you have
          to do is goto a payphone and page the owner of the pager to the
          payphone and bull shit him into something stupid like &quot;This is
          Michael Donaldson from SkyTel. We have lost some information on
          your SkyTel account. We need it for billing purposes.&quot; He will
          almost 99.99% of the time give it up. Your next step is to CNA
          his number and get all the information on the number. Now you
          have all the information on his SkyTel account. The best accounts
          to get phree pagers with are corporate accounts because they
          usually have many pagers under the account and will let you ship
          a large quantity of pagers out at one time.

Typical Conversation with Skytel to get Phree Pagers:

(if you have a UPS bin number all the better. BIN = billing identification
number. AKA bill shipping to another company).

    ME: &quot;A SkyTel Tango 2 Way Pager &quot; -- $400 each
    SB: &quot;Ok, I am filling an order for a Tango, would you like any extra
         options on this pager&quot;
    ME: &quot;Yes, the SkyTalk, SkyNews, SkyFax, SkyQuote and with nationwide and
         international coverage please&quot; (one fuckin loaded pager)
    SB: &quot;Ok, that will be shipped out tomorrow&quot;
    ME: &quot;Miss, one thing.. I am in Canada right now at a Business conference
         can you ship it over here.&quot;
    SB: &quot;Sure. Whats the address you want it delivered to.&quot;
    ME: (give her the dropsite)
    SB: &quot;Is there anything else.&quot;
    ME: &quot;No thanks. You have yourself a good day and a Merry Christmas!!!&quot;

15. Taking over a SkyTel Mailbox

    Hint: If you find a pin with option 3# on it. Which is alpha-numeric
          paging. Call it up. The SkyTel operator will read you the name
          of the owner of the pager. Now you have the owner. All you have
          to do is goto a payphone and page the owner of the pager like
          a million times and if he doesn't respond do it every day for
          a week. This usually means the pager isn't in use. So this will
          be a good SkyTel to take over.

Typical Conversation with Skytel to takeover a SkyTel Mailbox:

 SB=Skytel Bitch
 ME=PBXPhreak

    Call 800-SKY-USER

    ME: &quot;Hi, this is Michael Donaldson from AirTouch Paging&quot;
    SB: &quot;How can I help you&quot;
    ME: &quot;A customer was getting some options moved around when
         our computers crashed over on our system and I need to make
         some changes quickly, and our technician won't be here for
         awhile. He verified all the information correctly before the
         system crashed.
    SB: &quot;What is the pin number on the account&quot;
    ME: &quot;7599823&quot;
    SB: &quot;OK.. What needed to be changed&quot;
    ME: &quot;He wanted to add SkyTalk and SkyFax and change his code to 9172&quot;
    SB: &quot;Ok i will do that now..&quot;
    ME: &quot;Who am I speaking too. So I can tell my manager.&quot; (just bullshit)
    SB: (some stupid name)
    ME: &quot;Ok, Thank You.&quot;
    SB: &quot;Is there anything else.&quot;
    ME: &quot;No that is fine&quot;
    SB: &quot;Have a good day&quot;

    That is a basic conversation that will get them to change the password,
    and add options to the account.

16. Prefixes for SkyTel Pagers and Voicemail

      800-203-xxxx
      800-213-xxxx
      800-436-45xx
      800-436-78xx
      800-757-xxxx
      800-759-xxxx (original region 759=SKY)

Ways of scanning:

   - Scan by Hand. I would try using Substance's Random Scan program to
     generate numbers in the prefixes mentioned above.

   - Toneloc is available at ftp.fc.net /pub/defcon/TONELOC
