--------[  Rumble in the Mumble


    More than 6 months have passed since our last offering.  My most humble,
sincere and heartfelt apologies.  At long last, here we are.  Better late then
never, that's what I always say.  Unless of course, the late version sucks,
then I just like to disavow it entirely.  Well, here we go again.  Another
Phrack issue to glorify behavior which would otherwise be classified as
sociopathic or frankly psychotic (according to Mich Kabay).  More of what you
want, more of what you need.  Technical articles on fanatically enticing
topics, lines and lines of glorious source, another gut-busting installment of
Loopback, and of course, the News.  Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to
be hackers.  Or hookers for that matter.

    Alright.  Let's get down to business.  Let's talk remote attack paradigms.
Remote attack paradigms can fall into one of two types, based off of the
standard client/server communication paradigm (we are glossing over any
extensions to the model like client to client or server to server stuff).  The
two attack types are client to server (server-centric) and server to client
(client-centric).  Server-centric attacks are well known, understand and
documented.  Client-centric attacks are an area that is often overlooked, but
is definitely fertile ground for exploitation.  Below we look at both.


----[  Server-Centricity

    Historically, the vast majority of remote attacks have been server-centric.
Server-centric, in this scope, refers to attacks that target server (or daemon)
programs.  A common (and frequently reoccurring) example is sendmail.  The
attack targets a server (the sendmail daemon) and approximates a client (the
exploit program).  There are several reasons why this has been the trend:

    -   Server programs typically run with elevated privileges.  Server
        programs usually require certain system resources or access to special
        files that necessitate privilege elevation (of course we know this
        doesn't have to be the case; have a look at POSIX 6).  A successful
        compromise could very well mean access to the target system at that
        (higher) privilege level.

    -   Discretion is the attacker's whim.  The client/server message paradigm
        specifies that a server provides a service that a client may request.
        Servers exist to process clientele requests.  As per this model, the
        attacker (client) makes a request (attack) to any server offering
        the service and may do so at any point.

    -   Client codebase is usually simple.  Dumb client, smart server.  The
        impact of this is two-fold.  The fact that server code tends to be
        more complex means that it is tougher to audit from a security
        stand-point.  The fact that client code is typically smaller and less
        complex means that exploitation code development time is reduced.

    -   Code reuse in exploitation programs.  Client-based exploitation code
        bases are often quite similar.  Code such as packet generators and
        buffer overflow eggs are often reused.  This further cuts down on
        development time and also reduces required sophistication on the part
        of the exploit writer.

    All of these make server-centric attacks enticing.  The ability to
selectively choose a program to attack running with elevated privileges and
quickly write up exploit code for it is a powerful combination.  It is easy to
see why this paradigm has perpetuated itself so successfully.  However, up
until recently it seems another potentially lucrative area of exploitation has
gone all but overlooked.


----[  Client-Centricity

    An often neglected area of exploitation is the exact reverse of the above:
client-centricity.  Client-centric attacks target client programs (duh).  The
types of programs in this category include: web browsers (which have seen more
then their share of vulnerabilities) remote access programs, DNS resolvers and
IRC clients (to name a few).  The benefits of this attack model are as follows:

    -   Automated (non-discretionary) attacks.  We know that, under the
        previous paradigm, the attacker has complete autonomy over who s/he
        attacks.  The benefit there is obvious.  However, non-discretionary
        attacking implies that the attacker doesn't even have to be around
        when the attack takes place.  The attacker can set up the server
        containing the exploit and actually go do something useful (tm).

    -   Wide dispersement.  With client-centric attacks you can gain a wider
        audience.  If a server contains a popular service, people from all over
        will seek it out.  Popular websites are constantly bombarded with
        clientele.  Another consideration: server programs often run in
        filtered environments.  It may not be possible for an attacker to
        connect to a server.  This is rarely the case in client-centric 
        attacks.

    -   Client codebase not developed with security in mind.  If you think
        server code is bad, you should see some client code.  Memory leaks and
        stack overruns are all too common.

    -   Largely an untapped resource.  There are so many wonderful holes
        waiting to be discovered.  Judging at how successful people have been
        in finding and exploiting holes in server code, it goes to figure that
        the same success can be had in client code.  In fact, if you take into
        account the fact that the codebase is largely unaudited from a
        security perspective, the yields should be high.

    For all the above reasons, people wanting to find security holes should
be definitely be looking at client programs.  Now go break telnet.

    &quot; The advent of information availability and a rise in the number people
    for whom the net has always been 'the norm' is producing a class of users
    who cannot think for themselves.  As reliance upon scripted attacks
    increases, the number of people who personally possess technical knowledge
    decreases. &quot;
