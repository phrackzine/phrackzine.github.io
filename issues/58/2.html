  Our mailboxes were flooded by replies....99% of them should have gone to
/dev/null - 1% of these 99% are published below. Let's start with some logs
of hack attempts we experienced on our own server and from logs sent to us
by other readers (sorted in descending order, most stupid hacker first...).

* PHRACK58/#phrack will not be released until the 29th, sorry everyone!
&lt;#phrack:zknown_&gt; are you serious?
&lt;#phrack:PHRACK58&gt; You'll have to wait for me to retype everything from
                   the hardcopy edition.
&lt;#phrack:PHRACK58&gt; someone, release phrack now...
&lt;#phrack:tknown&gt; who releases phrack
&lt;#phrack:PHRACK58&gt; we'd like to gather a crowd to witness that historic
                   event.
-:- PHRACK58 was kicked off #phrack by rknown (please work out your issues)

  [ From time to time people pretend or try to impersonate 'phrack'
    and spread false informations :&gt; Phrack will be released on schedule..]

[08:34] - Just another scan from a.b.c.d (nothing unusual, our host is the

I got your email addresses from &quot;The Notorious B.O.O.G.&quot;. 

  [ Yeah babe, he is a very close friend of all of us! ]

I've been stuck in the past few days with
what an effective strategic &amp; tactical position the
hacker community inhabits in war time.

  [ Woah. Here we go. Uncle Sam unlock your weapon, target your enemy

The following is an email that I sent to &quot;The
Notorious B.O.O.G.&quot; and that he posted (with his
response) on www.guerrillanews.org on 9.19.2001.

  [ Y0. I've got some 30,000 warriors gathering at Norad. Let's unite

I am engaged in independant research of terrorist
organizations.  I would love to discuss these ideas
further with you if you have interest.

  [ RIGHT ON! y0 mrs.LittleMissPatriot, we already have all this stuff

United Future Underground
By Iconoclast

This is the long distance call,
Telephoning one and all,
Hackers and Phreakers Unite!
Organize and join the fight!

To those who play with phones,
And those who record the tones,
To those who hack the code,
And those who change the mode,
To those who scan the waves,
And those who encrypt their saves,
To those who build with chips,
And those who program MIPS.

Each passing day brings new laws
Perceived crimes without a cause,
Your freedoms and liberties
Are outlawed this day you see,
Fear, uncertainty and doubt
Feed Big Brother's deadly route.

Will they demand your crypto key?
Stand up and save your liberty!
Will they take your frequencies?
Or sell them at the highest fee?

Will they impose a modem tax,
And crank it up high to the max?
Will they tap your telephone line?
Since the FBI thinks its fine!

Illegal information?
Surveillance of a nation!
Censorship of silent truth?
We have the encrypted proof!

Its long past time we undertook
Steps to prove we're not evil crooks.
Educate the public today
On the path of the true hacker way.

is there a way I can get an issue of phrack sent to me, I'll mail for

You may think I'm just a pseudo anarchist, a &quot;fight club&quot; fan, but
it's true : one day or the other, we'll all end up as slaves of larges
corporations.

  [ NO! You are serious, and only serious people make it into Loopback. ]

You are all making effort to avoid this. thank You.

  [ Our secret mission is to form phrack &amp; Co. to control the slavery. ]

We need to go further, and this is the point of this mail :
we need to transpose hacking to the offline world:

  [ NO BRAIN. NO DICK. NO CARRIER. ]

we need to get falsified medical prescription and put Valium in coffee
machines. We need to spread false rumours harming corporations, like there
is arsenic in procter &amp; gamble soap, things like that, u see?

  [ http://www.phrack.org/howto - we do not publish information which
    is already known to the public. ]

we need to glue the locks of offices, police stations, luxuous cars, maybe
even schools!

  [ maybe your ass ? or maybe you should stop sniffing glue ? ]

nothing is static, everything is falling apart.
