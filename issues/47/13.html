In the past few months or so I have noticed that most places are
hopping on the Prepaid Calling-Card (PCC for short) bandwagon. PCCs
are a cheap alternative to normal long distance. (Or are supposed to be.)
For all of you that don't have any idea what a PCC is or how it works, here's
the full info:

Prepaid Calling-Cards are cards shaped like normal calling cards
and look exactly like them.  On their back, all PCCs have a 800 dialup,
a 9-12 digit code (give or take a few digits) and a customer service number
to report trouble.  All of these are sold in such a fashion that nosy phreaks
can't just read the backs and call the dialup and use it, without buying them.

PCCs almost always have calling limits.  Most available in the US are only
good within the US or US territories.  With certain cards, you have the
option to dial international but this will give you about 1-2 minutes of
actual usage on a 10 minute card, so I don't recommend calling Int'l
with these.  There are a few more restrictions blocking calls to any SAC.
(Special Area Code, like 700, 800, 900)  Domestic dialing is about all you
can do and still get your money's worth.  To sum it up, a PCC has a slotted
amount of time or dollar amount to use.  As far as getting a good deal goes,
you can't:  you break even, or you get ripped off.


PCC's are very easy to find.  They tend to turn up in the oddest
places.  You don't even have to look hard; they just pop out with banners,
signs and other various ads, so they are not hard to find. Some places
where I have found them are:  most grocery stores, some Toy Stores,
Greeting Card Shops, Quickee Marts, in packs of Sports cards and even at
Sporting good stores.

I thought this would be a particularly useful topic to write about due
to the fact anybody can benefit from these.  However, I'm not talking about
going to the store and buying them.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out
what to do with them.  They run a very simple system so anybody can use it.
(I mean, how hard is it to enter your digits when instructed?)

Most of these cards are basically copycats of each other.  They all have
some deal with a big long distance company.  After you enter the valid
number they tell you how much time is left on you card.  They all have an
operator that comes on just to tell you when 1 minute is left on your card.
(BTW, that fucks up any modem connection).  Plus, all of these services
run 800 numbers and are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Last but
not least, these don't show up on your phone bill.

Some people are set on never using stolen codes. (*cough*Emmanuel*
Goldstein*cough*cough)  But this is different since you're not really
stealing from any person by taking these.  You are not putting some
middle-class people from the Burbs out $20,000 like an abused calling card
that was passed around could.  So it's really not bad; besides, everybody's
doing it!

Hack 'em, Crack 'em, LD Pack 'em. Steal 'em, Deal 'em, Conceal 'em.

There's a new company called Talk 'N Toss.  They are offering a huge
variety of PCCs to chain stores that would buy a large amount for their
numerous stores.  Once a large company buys into this, they get set lines to
use for their card.  Then they customize them for their company name and
plugs.  I have seen Talk 'N Toss (TNT) sell 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 90 and 180
minute cards.  If you get a 90 minute card (or longer) that's the real jackpot.
90 Minutes is the largest minute card I have ever seen them selling.
If you wish to place an order to sell them at &quot;your&quot; business, dial their
customer service hotline toll-phree at [800] 631-8895.  Plus I'm sure you
can SE the lady into getting free cards.  (I've done it once so I know that
it can be done.)  They claim that you save up to 38% from a normal AT&amp;T
Call Card.  Bullshit maybe, but who the fuck knows.

I have seen these selling only two places.  The first is a grocery store
in Colorado (719 NPA) called Albertson's.  I don't know if this grocery
store is only located in Colorado, but that's where I happened to run into it.
I do not know the dialup or the proper amount of digits for this card.
It only sells in intervals of 30 and 90 minutes.  This is one of the few
cards with which you can call international.  For example, when calling
international they say that $1 of what you paid is equal to 3 LD minutes,
or about half a international minute...RIPOFF!

The other place I have seen TNT cards is Revco drugstore (formerly
Brooks Drugs.)  They have 10 minute card for $3.99 and a 20 minute card for
$9.99, 30 minutes for $14.99 and finally a 90 minute phone card goes for
a whopping $24.99.  Deal or not?  You decide.  If you decide you won't pay
for this crock of shit call 'em and hack 'em! At [800] 213-0304
with 10 digit PINs for their cards.  The time amount doesn't change the digit
amount. They have a CS number through which you can SE employees or just
complain to them at: [800] 354-2708.

Hello Direct, the phone supplies company, is offering their version
of TNT's PCC called the Prepaid Phone Card (PPC).  They're identical models
to the Revco TNT cards.  The dialup is [800] 955-2383 and the PINs are 9
digits.  These cards are the real jackpot with 180 minute cards for $50,
80 minutes for $29 and 50 minute cards for $18.  These are by far the
best deals around.

Marvel Comics and Kay-Bee have put their heads together and are now
offering X-Men PCCs.  There's 2 things you can do with these cards.  The first
option you have is use it for 20 minutes of long distance (no international.)
The second option is to play some stupid X-Men game.  The game uses 4 minutes
(or units, as they call them) of your card.  You start with 20 units,
with each unit equivalent to 1 minute.  Basically the hot idea they have
to sell these is 4 different cards, each with supposedly famous X-Men 1 on 1
battle scene.  Plus they claim they are a limited edition.  Yeah, they may
be a limited edition but so is Phrack.  They have taken a little more security
than other cards by having a scratch off number on the back, so you can't
just pop off the outer plastic and see the PIN.  I find these to be some of
my favorite PCCs to use because you have 20 minutes, which is fairly decent,
plus they are easy to swipe.  I just go to my Kay-Bee toys and take a bunch
to the back and open them, and either steal the card or write down the number
and hide the card.  In a sick way, I find writing down the number more fun
because when someone finds it and thinks that they are hot shit by stealing
it they'll run into a nice message saying that they have no time left and
they can't do shit with it.  To further experiment call [800] 616-8883.
The cards are 9 digits long.

Champs Sporting Goods Store has a new deal whereby if you purchase over
$35 worth of sports shit you get a card for a free 7 minute call.  Technically,
it ain't free since you're buying merchandise.  Seven minutes basically ain't
worth your time, but if you can get it for free it's worth every minute.
You can usually get some dumbass clerk to let you look at the cards because
they keep them on the cash register.  One lady said to me, &quot;Now don't pocket
that,&quot; as I was putting it into my pocket...oh well, dumbass.  The
number is [800] 437-6404.  With 9 digits for your PIN.

Randomly inserted into Classic 4-Sport sports cards are Sprint Prepaid
FoNCARDS.  Classic Games have joined with Sprint for numerous deals, this
being one.  Classic 4-Sport is a pack of sports cards that depict players
going to the pro's next year for 4 different sports. Those sports are
Baseball, Football, Basketball and Hockey.  Now, what the fuck would some
baseball card collector do with a Prepaid Foncard?  I still haven't figured
it out.  But some dealers tell me it's just another marketing thing because
collectors think they're a limited edition.  The cards are only worth $2
of LD anyway.  While the odds of finding a Sprint FoNCARD is 1:72.
(Which means 1 out of every 72 packs).  I know very little about this
since I haven't seen much out of them.  They do have a scratch off PIN on
the back.  To collectors, if the card has been scratched then the card
looses half of it's &quot;value.&quot;  OOOOh scary.

Classic is trying to offer something to the collector again.  But
this time it's about real money.  Not opening a $1.50 pack of cards.  They're
now offering 1, 5, 10, 20 and 1000 dollar cards to dealers.  These are such a
hot commodity that the prices double every quarter!  I asked some ripoff
artist what the deal was on getting the cards.  He said that for a $1000
card you must pay a $750 down payment with a max order of 1.  On other
styles you have to order 18 cases to get them wholesale.  That's 108 total
cards.  I'm sure you can find them singular.  Try looking in your local
sports page for ads for Sportscard conventions...at those you can swipe them.

To fuck around with these, call up [800] 868-9871 with 10 digits to
get a set amount of time.

        Sports fans listen up once again. GTE is offering 25 minute PCCs
that look like actual calling cards. But with these cards you can order a PCC
with a professional football team logo and helmet located on the front of it. They call these
&quot;NFL Collectables&quot; they are called. But the minimum order is 2 cards. Plus
with each order you get sent a 5 minute bonus card that features helmets from
all 30 NFL teams on it. To order each card is only $14.75 but you have to get
2. Call 1-800-GTE-3804 in the US. And outside the US call [303] 743-4138,
extension 712. Or just fax your order to [303] 727-4994. You must order these
with a credit card. I saw this add in Sports Illustrated.

This next one I would call my first love because it's what directed my
attention to the Prepaid Calling-Card field.

Hallmark is also working with Sprint to rip you off for that special occasion.
They started out printing normal greeting cards. (ie:  Happy Birthday,
Get Well, When Will You Finally Get Laid, etc...)  But then they got more
specific with their Christmas PCCs.  Now Valentine's Day is nearing and they
are selling Valentine's PCCs.  All of these cards are $5.95 for the card and
have 10 minutes of LD.  You can call anywhere in the US and its territories
(Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico), but no Int'l.

The main reason I fell in love with these is because of their mass
availability.  I have millions of Hallmarks in my area, and these cards are
easy to get for free.  These are greeting cards you just open like a normal
card.  They are poly-wrapped so they think you won't see the dialup &amp; PIN,
but, DAMN, they're wrong.  The card has a cheap layer of glue on the middle
so if you free the card from it's gluey seal, you can pull the plastic back
to reveal the dialup and PIN.  I enjoy spending spare time going to Hallmark
getting the PINs, leaving the card behind so I can have the joy of someone
else buying the card and getting no time!!

There are 3 dialups for the 3 kinds of cards.  It doesn't matter what
dialup you use, all work for any card.  The first is the regular greeting for
the normal cards:  [800] 504-1115.  For the Happy Holidays greeting, call
[800] 203-1225.  The Valentine Line has a new and original message, which
for the first time says Sprint before Hallmark, at [800] 214-0214.  All of
these cards are 10 digits.

They have a Customer Service which is really just a branch of the large
Sprint CS, at [800] 516-2121.  The last fact about the Hallmark PCCs is
that their quality has become more flimsy with each new line of card.
For example, the first kind was hard like a normal PCC, but now the
Valentine's Day cards are shitty as hell...like a normal sheet of paper.

Hallmark also has this nifty little ANi thingee they use.  The computers
at Sprint know the PiN you used PLUS the number you called PLUS the
number you called from.  If you find a PiN just call up their Customer
Service and you can find out who people called and from what number.

Now we have the Pepsi-Cola company.  They are stupid asses who offer lousy
service, but help hackers.  They list the dialup on the back of the box!
The cards are randomly inserted in Pepsi Holiday 12 Packs.  Just go to any
Grocery Store and open the boxes looking for the cards.  This PCC would have
to claim the most money spent on advertising, since it is the only one with
a TV commercial.  Plus the cards are only good for 5 minutes of LD,  no Int'l.
The dialup is [800] 929-COLA (3642).  Once you call it says, &quot;Enter Your
14 Digit Code.&quot;  That's just asking to be ripped off.

7-11, the slurpee guys, are now working with AT&amp;T to bring you their
7-11 Phone Cards.  It's supposed to save 50% or more than a LD collect call or
normal calling card. Obviously this is a big crock of shit.  On the brochure
it shows a data table comparing a 3 minute call from LA to NY.  It says a 7-11
Phone Card is $1.00, Collect Call is $3, a Payphone is $2.70, and a normal
calling card is $1.70.  I know when I call LD it's only like 15 cents so a
minute, not this ripoff.  They are available in 15, 30 or 60 minute cards.
I found a nice sales pitch on the brochure.  It says &quot;After your time is used
up, the card becomes inactive and you just buy a new card!&quot;  Yeah, right.
With this PCC you can call Int'l.  One main clue is that one side of the
brochure is all in Spanish.  But it says all calls must originate from within
the US.  (So you can't give them to your German friends and say they're real
Calling Cards.)  It warns you that since international rates vary a 15 minute
card could only be 5 minutes.  They don't actually give you that amount of
time; it depends entirely on where you call.  It's setup so you have a certain
amount of credit and once that's used, fuck how many minutes are left...your
time is up.  Remember, when you want a 7-11 card it is always best to ask
for Habib-Jabib.  I don't have any further info on these cards, like dialups
and shit.

Var-Tec Telecom, (10XXX = 10811) the new baby bell out of Texas, is
offering their version of PCCs called &quot;Prepaid Phone Pass&quot;.  You can
dial their automated service and enter a string of numbers to order the
cards.  I know very little regarding this service, except you can order
cards specifically for Domestic or for International calls, or both.

Their automated service number is:  [800] 583-8811.  Once connected, enter
this string of numbers:  6, 2 then 1 (To Talk To Consultant) or 3
(For Orders).

PCCs are not only for LD; some people are actually collecting them.
No, not for any illegal services but as a hobby.  People like them for their
pretty pictures of designs or special events.  People are comparing this to
(*fun*) stamp and coin collecting.  So if there is a demand for new styles it
must be found in a catalog, and I've found that catalog...for a price:

        If you wish to order a 400 card catalog for $5 from :

                        Lin Overholt
                        PO Box 8481
                        Madeira Beach, FL 33738

        You can also purchase a publication entitled

                &quot;International Telephone Cards&quot;

        by writing to :

                        29/35 Manor Road
                        Colchester, Essex CO3 3LX
                        Great Britain

Electronics Boutique, or EB for short, is offering PCCs with $5 worth
of LD on them.  Dialup is [800] 233-1363 with 9 digits PIN.  I know very,
little regarding these.

Shit From Al K. Lloyd [4o4]. Slightly Modified of course.

Since I've started collecting these suckers,
here's some other prepaids for you guys (Treason)
to add to the file in BTR:

- AT&amp;T/Knights Inn [800] 357-PAID(7243) - 9 digits
  Customer Service is [800] 462-1818
  Glossy cardboard cards in 15 or 25 &quot;units&quot;
  These are sold at the hotel chain

- PrimeCall [800] 866-6915 - 14 digits
  But try starting with 407-xxxx-xxxx-xxx (just a hunch)
  Customer service [800] 938-4949
  Card is plastic in $10 and $20-I think only one design w/a bunch of flags
  on it; these guys are going for the international crowd (oddly enough,
  these are the only ones I've seen dispensed from a machine)

- Western Union [800] 374-8686 - 8 digits
  These guys charges are ridiculous--try them 1st...
  Customer Service is [800] 374-8686; the cards are thin cardboard to
  boot-$10, $20, or $50

- Caber Communications [800] 868-9871 - 10 digits
  Caber/Talk Lite [800] 429-9547 - 10 digits
  Customer Service is [800] 716-2444 or [404] 876-2444 (local to me)
  Some of the nicest cards I've seen; $5, $10, and $20
  Fairly good rates considering what there is to pick from (like Western
  Union)

These things keep popping up like mushrooms...
Caber's rates just look good compared to Western Union :&gt;
Revco Talk n' Toss is the cheapest I've found so far...
only available here in 10, 30, and 100 min. To my knowledge.

Second cheapest is:
Transcommunications, Inc.
Transcard
800-326-4880 11 digits
800-772-7293 Customer Service

Cards are also available in Spanish,  in $10 &amp; $20 denominations
(not marked on the card, cards can be recharged by CC @ 800-772-7293.)

I found this at a Conoco gas station; according to their C.S. they're
also available at various truck stops, Pilots, Kangaroos, and a bunch more.

I tell ya, I run into a new one of these every time I turn around...

Regarding Caber PCCs :

Caber has sales reps that go to immigrant stores to unload the cards.  They
carry their inventory in business card folders that seem to carry 46 cards
or so.  If a folder got stolen, there is no way to tell who bought which card,
unless it was a fresh folder (in which case they'd just notify the Co.).

Caber Communications has 2 different kinds of cards, Caber and
Talk Lite.  I'll categorize these by line and amount.  (The following are
no longer valid cards.)

General Info

I noticed some stuff in the Sunday coupon section.  Some food company is
giving 10 minute cards if you send in proofs of purchase; so is Polaroid
(with a nifty hologram kard).

A Post From An Unknown User in Atlanta :

As far as PCC's go, I noticed on 4 or 5 of mine that all of the numbers were
divisible by 33... Maybe there's some sort of algorithm that controls the
numbers on these cards.  This particular case was an MCI/NBC sweepstakes, each
card giving 10 minutes...

Another thing to wonder about when &quot;carding&quot; these cards:  Sooner
or later, someone must notice people carding.  So, do they track
these cards or anything?  Or do you just have to use them short-term,
etc...?  To anyone that works for a convenience store:  what's the
policy on stolen cards?  Do you report them to AT&amp;T or whomever as
stolen?  Give them numbers?  And what follow up is done?

Recently in a trip to Boston [617] I was at a magazine stand.  After
I put down the newest Hustler I saw a rack of brochures from a service
called &quot;Worldcall 2000 - The World's Most Advanced Prepaid Telephone
Service.&quot;  Since I was working on this text, I thought I'd pick
it up for some info.

Their cards some in $10, $20, $30 and $50 telephone card increments.
They also have service available in 10 different languages, although what
languages I don't know.  They have international and domestic dialing
capabilities with cheap rates.  Plus, they have a built in VMB with forward
messaging and recharge capability.  The customer service department is
[800] 576-8522.

Here's what you do:  Dial [800] 576-9959, enter the PiN, then for a domestic
call, dial 1+ACN; for international dial 011+Number.  If you fuck up,
just hit &quot;*&quot; to enter another number.  To make another call when you're
done just hit &quot;#&quot;.  That's a rather sweet feature.  (This is from AT&amp;T.)

Here's a first:  Recently at a local book store I was reading the new
issue of Fangoria.  In it, I saw an add for Freddy Krueger PCCs!
(you know the man...)  &quot;Bullshit,&quot; I thought.  They come in 4 different
cards, each with a new fun, gruesome decapitation by my man Freddy. Then
the biggest bullshit of all:  &quot;Good For Making Local Calls.&quot;  These
cards are only available in 15 minute cards.  Plus they're $14.95 + $x.xx
shipping and handling.  I don't know any more about them than that.

Here's Some Stuff From Me Bud, Antediluvian [4o4]


Drug Emporium is offering a $10 card with a total value for up to 25
minutes. You can call both domestic and international. The number is:
[800] 866-7495. One that I have already used is 2105-253-835, therefore they
are 10 digits.

I hear that Taco Bell has some awesome prepaids too. I'll look into that
for you.  Also a friend of mine, ViRuS?, (with the question mark) who runs
DCi has an algorithm for a prepaid, TLI or something like that... I have to
deliver some files to him so I'll ask about it.
                                        ...     Ante
