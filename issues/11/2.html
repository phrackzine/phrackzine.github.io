                                   2/17/87

         Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile VIII.  Phrack Pro-Phile is created to
bring info to you, the users, about old or highly important/controversial
people.  This month, I bring to you one of the older and high profile phreaks
of the past...

                              Wizard of Arpanet
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         Wizard of Arpanet is one of the older of the phreak/hack generation.
His main accomplishments include running Inner Circle and Secret Service BBS.

                       Handle: Wizard of Arpanet
                     Call him: Eric
                 Past handles: The Hacker and The Priest
                Handle Origin: A real programmer on Arpanet was called The
                               Wizard and Eric took his handle from him.
                Date of Birth: 02/26/69
Age in 9 days of this writing: 18 years old
                       Height: 6'1&quot;
                       Weight: 150 lbs
                    Eye color: Blue
                   Hair color: Dishwaterish blond
                    Computers: Atari 400, Commodore 64
            Sysop/Co-sysop of: Secret Service

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Wizard of Arpanet started as your average BBS caller.  He eventually
called Central Processing Unit (a local board to him), and there were these
funny numbers on the board.  He called and tried to connect with his modem,
but they turned out to be Sprint dial-ups.  The CPU Sysop informed him of what
to do and he started calling national BBSs.  Boards that helped him to advance
include the Twilight Zone (the sysop was the guy that wrote T-Net), OSUNY,
Dragon's Lair, and Delta BBS.  Wizard organized various groups which included
(from earliest to most recent): PHA (Phreakers and Hackers of America) -
(included Deep Throat, Phreak King, and Psycho Killer), The Inner Circle (1st
one) (included Shockwave Rider, and Satan Knight aka Redrum), and The 2nd
Inner Circle (included The Cracker, Mr. America, Napoleon Bonapart, Stainless
Steal Rat, Big Brother, Mr. Xerox, Bootleg, Maxwell Wilke, Mandrake The
Magician, and Zaphod Beeblebrox).

         Eric got the number to Arpanet from Dark Dante, and got on the MIT
Research System from looking through TAC News.  One night he got like 50-60
accounts on the Unix and changed all of the passwords to WIZARD.

         Stainless Steal Rat, the Sysop of Delta BBS, and The Myth were all up
from NJ one weekend, and they were staying the weekend at John Maxfield's
house.  They went to John's office.  Wizard asked Maxfield if he could use his
computer to print out some things he had with him and he printed out some
stuff from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence address list for Arpanet.
John was amazed.  &quot;Wow,&quot; he said, &quot;I have prime evidence on you.&quot; (TK: This
may not for sure be an exact quote).  He then proceeded to bust our friend,
Eric, the next week.  He also had a lot of stuff from AUTOVON from some fellow
in Washington and started playing with the FTS lines (Federal Telephone
System) which he found from, none other than, John Maxfield.  They had found
the default passwords for TeleMail too, and got the administrator accounts and
set up their own BBS on Nassau and Coca-Cola systems plus anywhere else
possible.  And all of a sudden, it all came down when Mandrake decided to
crash parts of TeleMail.  Enter, Federal Bureau of Investigations.  They had
been monitoring Eric for 6 months looking for some evidence to get him on.
And thus, they got it.  Nothing really happened, but he had to get a lawyer
and he got some publicity in the paper.  After 90 days, everything they had
taken, with the exception of a few documents, was sent back.  During those 90
days, Eric worked as a computer security consultant at a bank making $200 an
hour (2 hours...).

         The only &quot;phreaks&quot; he's met are Stainless Steal Rat and Cable Pair.

         Eric has been mentioned on local TV/News, in newspapers, USA Today,
NY Times, Washington Post, Books, and Britannica Encyclopedia (look under
Hacker).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Interests: Music (preferably jazz, reggae, new wave), Eastern
                    philosophy (Zen Buddhism), reading Jack Kerouac books (a
                    great beatnik writer), driving aimlessly, slowly becoming
                    a social recluse, physics, and Greek mathematicians.

Eric's Favorite Things
----------------------

                    Women: The pursuit thereof (Karen Wilder).
                    Foods: Chinese.
                     Cars: BMW 320-I.
                   Artist: Salvador Dali.
Plans for next few months: Next year and a half - travelling to Montreal in
                           April for a week of leisure, then jetting back to
                           beautiful Detroit and continuing his studies at
                           Eisenhower High School.

Most Memorable Experiences
--------------------------

Realizing all at once that everything you did 3 years ago was stupid.
Growing into a new person.
Gaining morals and new ideas and a new outlook.

Some People to Mention
----------------------

Tuc (For telling him about boxing).
Tom Tone (For calling him on his first conference).
Magnetic Surfer (Talking to him for the first time after Sherwood Forest went
                 down voice).
John Maxfield (Meeting him).
Stainless Steal Rat (Meeting him...with John Maxfield).
Dark Dante (One of the legends phreakdom).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Always follow your instinct and not your desire for you will be
sorry because you will be lying to yourself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you enjoyed this file.  Look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming
in the near future.  ...And now for the regularly taken poll from all
interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  No, says Eric, he considers them a new
breed of intellect.  Thanks for your time, Eric.
