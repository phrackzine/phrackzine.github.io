Well, here it is:  Phrack 43.  This issue should really piss every security
professional off.  Well, actually, none of them should ever see it because
only two people have registered their subscriptions.

But, then again I think we all know that the whole world is FULL of
lying, thieving people who just don't care about other people's
property.  No, smarty, not hackers...computer professionals!

CASE 1:

The Computer Emergency Response Team.  Bastions of life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.  CERT had been on the Phrack mailing list
previously, and was sent a copy of 42 (as was everyone) to give them
the opportunity to subscribe.  Rather than do the right thing
and let us at Phrack know that they were not interested in paying,
and to take their name off the list, Ed DiHart instead forwarded off
several copies to his cronies.

Luckily for us, Ed is not the best typist, and the mail bounced all the way
back to Phrack.  I called Ed and asked him why he would do such a thing,
which was clearly a direct violation of US Copyright Law.  Ed claimed
he didn't know of any new rules for Phrack, and that he had always forwarded
off a few copies to his pals.  I told Ed that this practice was unacceptable
and that if he wanted to continue to get Phrack he and his pals would all have
to register their subscriptions.  Ed said that he did not want to pay
and to take CERT off the list.

A month prior to this Ed had said to me at the Computers, Freedom &amp; Privacy
conference in San Francisco, &quot;Why are YOU here anyway?  It sure is IRONIC
that someone whose goal in life was to invade other people's privacy would
be attending a conference on protecting privacy.&quot;  I walked away from him in
disgust.

While talking to Ed about Phrack I said, &quot;You know Ed, it sure is IRONIC
that an organization such as CERT, whose main goal is to help protect
the property of others would so flagrantly violate US Copyright law and
completely disregard someone's property rights.&quot;  Man, did that feel great!


CASE 2:

BT Tymnet.  Dale Drew, security guru, made the statement on IRC about
Phrack, &quot;I have absolutely no desire to pay for anything having to do with
hackers.&quot;  Later, someone from Dale's machine at BT Tymnet (opus.tymnet.com)
logged into Len Rose's machine and ftp'd Phrack 42.  With prior knowledge
Phrack was not free, he willingly used company property to commit a crime.
At most companies, that is grounds for termination.  Luckily for Dale
Tymnet doesn't give a shit.  In fact, Dale several times since has gone
back on IRC stating, &quot;People here are Tymnet are kind of upset about
Phrack 42.&quot;  This just shows that people at Tymnet are just as criminal
as they say hackers are.  Since they could care less about MY property,
then why should I care about theirs?  Maybe I should print a list of
all Tymnet internal NUIs!  Well, two wrongs won't make a right, so I better
not.

I did, however, send email to Dale stating that we were aware of Tymnet's
transgressions and that we may be forced to take legal action.  I have
decided to offer BT a sweet deal on a company-wide site license.  We
shall see if they take me up on this offer, or continue to steal Phrack.

CASE 3:

Gail Thackeray.  A woman sworn by the court to uphold the laws of the
land.  This woman had the audacity to tell me that unless I
enforced my copyright, it was worthless.  Unless I enforce it.  What the
hell does that mean?  Am I supposed to raid companies myself and
go dig for evidence that they have stolen my information?  Geez...it's
not like I'm Bellcore.  Gail's disgusting interpretation of the law,
that unless you are big enough to stand up for yourself then you have
no recourse, is a festering sore on the face of the American Legal system
and I personally am appalled that this woman is allowed to act as
a law enforcement professional.

Oh well, as you can tell I've had a little fun with all this.  And I have
effectively proven my point.  Security people, corporate professionals,
and law enforcement types are just as unscrupulous and unethical as they
have always claimed that we are.

Only TWO PEOPLE within the computer/legal/security profession have the right
to receive and keep copies of Phrack.  Winn Schwartau, and a man at Mitre.
It's amazing that they are the only ones with any scruples, isn't it?

Well, let's get on with the issue.  This one is pure, unadulterated evil.
Only the strong will survive this time.  We've got Cellular, we've got
Novell, we've got 5e, we've got PHRACK TRIVIA!  Get comfortable, grab
your favorite intoxicant, and enjoy.

*NOTES*  Some of you will recognize the 5ESS file from the Summer issue of
2600 magazine.  This file was sent to both myself and E. Goldstein.  I
was told by the author that 2600 was not printing it.  Wrong.  Well, we
got permission from 2600 to print it here too since its such a good file,
and since I spent like 8 hours dealing with the author correcting
and editing it.  In the future gang, if you send something to Phrack AND
to 2600, TELL US BEFOREHAND!  The last thing I want to hear is, &quot;Phrack
is plagiarizing 2600...gawd they are so lame.&quot;  The acronym file, you will
note, is DIFFERENT.  Heh.

In addition to the above, you may notice that we were a bit late in
distributing this issue.  As many of you saw through the &quot;resubscribe&quot;
blurb sent over the mailing list, Phrack is not going through Stormking.COM
any longer.  The struggle to relocate put us into further delays
but I've managed to take care of securing a new distribution site.
We want to thank everyone at Stormking for shipping Phrack out for
so long, and wish them the best in their future endeavors.
