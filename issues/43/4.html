      THE WORLD'S FIRST NOVEL-ON-THE-NET (tm) SHAREWARE!!!
                       By Inter.Pact Press

                      &quot;TERMINAL COMPROMISE&quot;
                        by Winn Schwartau

     A high tech thriller that comes from today's headlines!

&quot;The Tom Clancy of computer security.&quot;
          Assoc. Prof. Dr. Karen Forcht, James Madison University

&quot;Terminal  Compromise&quot; is a highly praised novel about the  inva-
sion of the United States by computer terrorists.

Since  it was first published in conventional print form,  (ISBN:
0-962-87000-5)  it has sold extremely well world-wide,  but  then
again,  it never hit the New York Times Bestseller  List  either.
But that's OK, not many do.

Recently,  someone we know very well came up with a  real  bright
idea.   They suggested  that INTER.PACT Press take  the  unprece-
dented,  and maybe slightly crazy, step to put &quot;Terminal  Compro-
mise&quot; on the Global Network thus creating a new category for book
publishers.   The  idea is to offer  &quot;Terminal  Compromise,&quot;  and
perhaps  other titles at NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm) rates  to
millions  of people who just don't spend a lot of time  in  book-
stores.   After  discussions with dozens of people -  maybe  even
more than a hundred - we decided to do just that.   We know  that
we're  taking a chance, but we've been convinced by  hackers  and
phreakers and corporate types and government representatives that
putting &quot;Terminal Compromise&quot; on the net would be a fabulous step
forward  into  the Electronic Age, (Cyberspace if you  will)  and
would encourage other publishers to take advantage of  electronic
distribution.   (It's still in the bookstores, though.)

To  the  best of our  knowledge,  no  semi-sorta-kinda-legitimate
-publisher has ever put a complete pre-published 562 page book on
the  network  as a form of Shareware.  So, I guess  we're  making
news  as  well as providing a service to the  world's  electronic
community.   The recommended NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE fees  are
outlined later (this is how we stay in business), so please  read
on.

WE KEEP THE COPYRIGHTS!

&quot;Terminal  Compromise&quot;  is  NOT  being  entered  into  the  public
domain.   It  is  being  distributed  electronically  so  hundreds
of thousands more  people  can enjoy it and  understand just where
we are heading with  our  omnipresent  interconnectedness  and the
potential dangers we face.  INTER.PACT Press  maintains  all copy-
rights to &quot;Terminal Compromise&quot; and does not, either intentionally
or  otherwise,  explicitly  or implicitly,  waive  any  rights  to
this  piece  of  work or  recourses  deemed  appropriate.  (Damned
lawyers.)

                TERMINAL COMPROMISE - THE REVIEWS

&quot;Schwartau  knows  about  networks and security  and  creates  an
interesting plot that will keep readers turning the pages.&quot;

&quot;An  incredibly fascinating tale of international intrigue . .  .

twists.   (He) makes it clear that the most important  assets  at
risk are America's right to privacy and our democratic ideals.&quot;

&quot;I  am  all  too familiar with the  appalling  realities  in  Mr.
Schwartau's book.  (A) potentially catastrophic situation.&quot;

&quot;  . . .  chilling scenarios . . . &quot;,  &quot;For light summer  reading
with  weighty implications . . . &quot;,  &quot; . . .  thought  provoking,
sometimes chilling . . . &quot;

Remember, it's only fiction.  Or is it?



                  TERMINAL COMPROMISE: SYNOPSIS

&quot;It's all about the information . . . the information.&quot;
                         From &quot;Sneakers&quot;

Taki Homosoto, silver haired Chairman of Japan's huge OSO  Indus-
tries,  survived Hiroshima; his family didn't. Homosoto  promises
revenge  against the United States before he dies.  His  passion-
ate, almost obsessive hatred of everything American finally comes
to a head when he acts upon his desires.

With  unlimited resources, he comes up with the ultimate  way  to
strike back at the enemy. Miles  Foster, a brilliant 33 year old
mathematician   apparently isn't  exactly  fond of America either.
The  National  Security  Agency wanted  his  skills, but his back-
ground and &quot;family&quot; connections kept him from advancing within the
intelligence  community.  His  insatiable - borderline psychotic-
sex drive  balances  the intensity  of waging war against his own
country to  the  highest bidder.

Scott  Mason,  made  his fortune selling high tech  toys  to  the
Pentagon.   Now as a New York City Times reporter,  Mason  under-
stands  both  the good and the evil of technology  and  discovers
pieces  of  the terrible plot which is designed  to  destroy  the
economy of the United States.

Tyrone  Duncan, a physically huge 50-ish black senior  FBI  agent
who suffered through the Hoover Age indignities, befriends  Scott
Mason.  Tyrone provides the inside government track and confusion
from competing agencies to deal with the threats.  His altruistic
and  somewhat pure innate view of the world finally makes him  do
the right thing.

As  Homosoto's  plan evolves, Arab zealots,  German  intelligence
agents and a host of technical mercenaries find the weaknesses in
our  techno-economic  infrastructure.   Victims  find  themselves
under  attack by unseen adversaries; Wall Street suffers  debili-
tating  blows; Ford and Chrysler endure massive shut downs.   The
U.S. economy suffers a series of crushing blows.

From  the White House to the Pentagon to the CIA to the  National
Security Agency and FBI, a complex weaving of fascinating politi-
cal characters find themselves enmeshed a battle of the New World
Order.   Sex,  drugs, rock'n'roll: Tokyo,  Vienna,  Paris,  Iraq,
Iran.  It's all here.

Enjoy reading &quot;Terminal Compromise.&quot;



                     SHAREWARE - NOVEL FEES:

We hope that you enjoy &quot;Terminal Compromise&quot; as much as  everyone
else  has, and that you will send us a few shekels  according  to
the following guidelines.

The  NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm)  fees for us as a  publishing
company  are no different than the fees for software  application
shareware publishers, and the intent is the same.  So please, let
us continue this form of publishing in the future.


NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE Fees For The People:

The suggested donation for individuals is $7.  If you hate Termi-
nal Compromise after reading it, then only send $6.50.  If you're
really, really broke, then tell a hundred other people how  great
it was, send us a rave review and post it where you think  others
will enjoy reading it, too.  If you're only a little broke,  send
a few dollars.  After all, this is how we stay in business.  With
each  registration, we will also send a FREE! issue of  &quot;Security
Insider Report,&quot; a monthly security newsletter also published  by
Inter.Pact Press.


NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE Fees For Businesses:

We  hope  that  you put &quot;Terminal Compromise&quot;  on  your  internal
networks so that your employees will have the chance to enjoy  it
as well.  It's a great way to increase security awareness amongst
this  country's 50,000,000 rank and file computer  users.   Plus,
it's a hell of a good read.

One  company  plans  on  releasing  a  chapter  every  few   days
throughout its E-Mail system as a combination of security  aware-
ness  and employee 'perc'.  Try it; it works and  your  employees
will  appreciate it.  Why?  Because they'll all talk about  it  -
bringing security awareness to the forefront of discussion.

THE STATE OF SECURITY IN CYBERSPACE

SRI International conducted a worldwide study in 1992 of a broad range of
security issues in &quot;cyberspace.&quot;  In brief, cyberspace is the full set of
public and private communications networks in the United States and elsewhere,
including telephone or public switched telephone networks (PSTNs), packet data
networks (PDNs) of various kinds, pure computer networks, including the
Internet, and wireless communications systems, such as the cellular telephone
system.  We did not address security vulnerabilities associated with
classified, secure communications networks used by and for governments.

The study was conducted as part of our ongoing research into the
vulnerabilities of various software components of cyberspace.  Our approach was
to conduct research through field interviews with a broad range of experts,
including people we characterize as &quot;good hackers,&quot; about security issues and
vulnerabilities of cyberspace and the activities of the international
&quot;malicious hacker&quot; community.

While the specific results of the study are proprietary to SRI, this brief
report summarizes our general conclusions for the many individuals who kindly
participated in our field interviews.  As we indicated during our field
interviews, the original research for this project was not part of any other
kind of investigation, and we have not revealed the identify of any of our
respondents.

The study aimed to understand &quot;malicious hackers,&quot; that is, people who have and
use the technical knowledge, capability, and motivation to gain unauthorized
access, for various reasons, to systems in cyberspace.  It is important to
understand that by no means all hackers are malicious nor does most hacking
involve unauthorized access to cyberspace systems; indeed, only a small
fraction of computer hacking involves such activities but gives hacking an
otherwise undeserved bad reputation.  While we attempted to focus on technical
(software) vulnerabilities, our interviews led us to look more at the broader
motivations and different approaches to cracking into various networks and
networked systems.

MAIN CONCLUSIONS

Our main conclusion is that social, organizational, and technological factors
still combine in ways that make much of cyberspace relatively vulnerable to
unauthorized access.  The degree of vulnerability varies from one type of
communications system to another.  In general, the PSTN is the least vulnerable
system, the PDNs are somewhat more vulnerable than the PSTN, the Internet is
relatively insecure, and as is widely known, the cellular phone system is the
most vulnerable of the four major areas we addressed.

The main vulnerabilities in most communications networks involves procedural,
administrative, and human weaknesses, rather than purely technical
vulnerabilities of network management, control systems, and hardware, and
software.  There are technical vulnerabilities--poor system design and specific
security flaws in software--but they are mainly exploitable because of the
above problems.

Highlights of the study's conclusions include:

o Malicious attacks on most networks and networked systems cannot be completely
prevented, now or in the future.  More than enough information is publicly
available to hackers and other technically-literate people to preclude attempts
at prevention of intrusions.

o It is possible individuals or groups could bring down individual systems or
related groups of systems, on purpose or by accident.  However, security is
generally improving as a result of dealing with past threats and challenges to
system security.  For instance, responses to the most recent serious threat to
the Internet, the so-called Internet Worm in 1989, included improved security
at sites vulnerable to this sort of worm.

o We found no evidence that the current generation of U.S. hackers is
attempting to sabotage entire networks.  On the contrary, doing so is
inconsistent with the stated ethics and values of the hacker community, which
are to explore cyberspace as a purely intellectual exercise without malicious
intent or behavior.  Some individuals who operate outside this informal ethical
framework, however, can and do damage specific systems and occasionally use
systems for personal gain or vindictive activities.

o There is some evidence that the newest generations of hackers, may be more
motivated by personal gain than the traditional ethic of sheer curiosity.  This
development could mean that networks and networked systems could become more
likely targets for attacks by hardened criminals  or governments' intelligence
services or their contractors (i.e., employing malicious hackers).  This threat
does not appear to be significant today but is a possible future scenario.

o The four major areas of vulnerability uncovered in our research have little
or nothing to do with specific software vulnerabilities per se.  They relate
more to the ways in which hackers can gain critical information they need in
order to exploit vulnerabilities that exist because of poor systems
administration and maintenance, unpatched &quot;holes&quot; in networks and systems, and
so on.
- The susceptibility of employees of businesses, public organizations, schools,
and other institutions to &quot;social engineering&quot; techniques
- Lax physical and procedural controls
- The widespread availability of non-proprietary and of sensitive and
proprietary information on paper about networks and computer systems
- The existence of &quot;moles,&quot; employees of communications and computer firms and
their suppliers who knowingly provide proprietary information to hackers.

o The vulnerabilities caused by shortcomings in software-based access controls
and in hardware-related issues constitute significantly lower levels of risk
than do the four areas discussed above on more secure networks such as the PSTN
and PDNs.  However, on the Internet and similar systems, software-based access
controls (for instance, password systems) constitute significant problems
because of often poor system maintenance and other procedural flaws.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on our research, we recommend the following:

1. Protection of organizational information and communications assets should be
improved.  Issues here range from those involving overall security systems to
training employees and customers about maintenance of security on individual
systems, handling and disposition of sensitive printed information, and dealing
with &quot;social engineering.&quot;

2. Techniques used to protect physical assets should be improved.  For example,
doors and gates should be locked properly and sensitive documents and equipment
guarded appropriately.

3. Organizations and their employees should be made aware of the existence and
role of moles in facilitating and enabling hacker intrusions, and care taken in
hiring and motivating employees with the mole problem in mind.

4. Software- and hardware-based vulnerabilities should also be addressed as a
matter of course in systems design, installation and maintenance.

5. Organizations concerned with information and communications security should
proactively promote educational programs for students and parents about
appropriate computer and communications use, personal integrity and ethics, and
legitimate career opportunities in the  information  industry, and reward
exemplary skills, proficiency and achievements in programming and ethical
hacking.

6. Laws against malicious hacking should be fairly and justly enforced.

SRI's believes that the results of this study will provide useful information
to both the operators and users of cyberspace, including the hacker community.
We are planning to continue our research in this area during 1993 within the
same framework and conditions (i.e., anonymity of all parties and
organizations) as we conducted the 1992 research.  We invite hackers and others
