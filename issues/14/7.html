Welcome to the first Phrack World News &quot;Special Edition.&quot;  In this issue we
have two parts.  The first section deals with possible news stories of the
future after the weekend of June 19-21... SummerCon '87!  The second section
is a presentation of acronyms that never were, but should be.  All posts have
been taken from Metal Shop Private prior to its takedown in June.  Posts have
been edited for this presentation.

PWN Special Edition is not a regular series and will only appear when the
author deems it necessary to release one.   Please keep in mind that all
material in this file was written several weeks prior to SummerCon '87 and
therefore the events chronicled here are supposed fiction and comedy.

Thank you -KL.

SummerCon Prank Backfires                                        June 31, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, the SummerCon went over well, except when the convention attendees stole
every payphone in the building and placed them in front of Taran King's hotel
room, rang the door, and shouted &quot;Room Service.&quot;  Needless to say, Taran King
is now in jail until he can pay for all the stolen payphones.

Phreak/Hack World Shut Down!                                     June 21, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It happened yesterday when John Maxfield accompanied by Ralph Meola, Richard
Proctor, Dan Pasquale, Edward P. Nowicki, and several members of the FBI,
Secret Service, National Security Agency, and local baggers 402 literally
invaded SummerCon '87, the annual phreak/hack reunion.  It has been reported
that a total of 97 suspects have been placed in custody with crimes linking
them to jay walking, loitering, curfew violation, disturbing the peace, and
belching in excessive amounts.

Details are sketchy but it appears that it all started when a very drunk pair
of twins decided to visit the local McDonald's and demanded a COSMOS Sundae
with passwords on the side.  When a very confused McDonald's employee refused,
they became agitated and whipped out a blue box, using it to open the &quot;trunks&quot;
of all the cars in the parking lot and then finally throwing it at an
employee. A mad crowd of people rushed to the Best Western Executive
International Inn and tried to storm the building when the other previously
mentioned uninvited guests arrived.

Final remarks from the twins... &quot;So who wants to discuss CAMA?&quot;

 Information provided by F. R. Newsline Services and on the scene reporting by
            Broadway Hacker (arrested for attempted prostitution).

SummerCon '87 &quot;Laugh Riot&quot;; Numerous Phreaks Still Missing       June 25, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(St Louis, PP)  Authorities are still searching for the nearly 100 missing
telecom enthusiasts who gathered in town over the weekend for a convention.
Apparently the missing parties were sitting around, undergoing the intake of
many assorted consciousness altering chemicals, when a strange young man with
shoulder length hair and wearing a Judas Priest jacket appeared.  He forced
them all into a white 1957 Chevy pickup and took off, leaving only Evil Jay
and Thomas Covenant behind.  Evil Jay was quoted as saying it was a &quot;laugh
riot.&quot; Thomas Covenant had nothing to say as he is in shock from the incident
and currently undergoing treatment at the St. Louis Home for the Terminally
Bewildered.

Computer Enthusiasts Infected With The AIDS Virus                June 22, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt;From St. Louis Post Dispatch

They called it &quot;SummerCon,&quot; a gathering of &quot;phone phreaks&quot; and computer
hackers who are loosely organized around a network of computer bulletin
boards. However, tragedy struck the meeting when the hacker named Evil Jay
tricked another hacker, Suicidal Nightmare, into entering the room belonging
to Broadway Hacker.  Suicidal Nightmare was found in the parking lot with a
torn anus.

As if this wasn't bad enough, Broadway Hacker then went wild and began trying
to molest the smallest hackers there.  He could be seen chasing Kango Kid
while screaming about a flaming mailbox and rubbing his genital area.

Other problems arose from the hackers meeting.  Several people were arrested
for possession of cannibus and illegal possession of alcohol.  The other
charges included:

o  Intoxicated Pedestrian
o  Disturbing the Peace
o  Contributing to the delinquency of a minor
o  Failure to yield at stop sign
o  No turn signal
o  Theft of telephones
o  Verbally harassing telephone operators

As you can see, these computer 'hackers' have no morals and decency and should
not be allowed to meet.

Phreak World Crippled; SummerCon Causes Despair                  June 22, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Today, the phreak world was astounded and dealt a horrifying blow as all the
phreaks who attended SummerCon left with their entire phreak knowledge
literally erased from their minds due to an excess of drinking and other
unknown mind altering substances.  It is unknown as to if these effects are
temporary or a life-long destruction.


Anarchy World Takes Charge                                       June 23, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MetalliBashers Inc. have become the new &quot;LOD&quot; of the modem world since all of
the LOD members no longer can even remember what LOD stands for (in fact, no
one can, and forget I mentioned it!).  With MBI taking charge, the new wave of
the modem world has turned strictly anarchy, although there are rumors of
various pirating organizations beginning to unload new wares soon.


Investigators Lose Jobs!                                         June 24, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John Maxfield reportedly lost ALL contracts today when it was discovered that
the phreak/hack community was completely destroyed, thus no one needed
protection from them.  He has now taken a job with the local sanitation
management firm to help figure out what to do with all the garbage now that
the phreak community wasn't stealing 1/3 of it anymore.

Suicidal Nightmare - History                                     June 23, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suicidal Nightmare met death head on when Evil Jay knocked on his door
pretending to be a lineman checking on his line.  Once inside, Jay proceeded
to swing a hand set at him with amazing accuracy.  Once dragged outside, Jay
then proceeded to tie Suicidal naked to a tree and call the ever-lovin'
Broadway Hacker over to do his stuff.  Jay was last heard pleading insanity.
Suicidal Nightmare remains in intensive care, and Broadway Hacker is happy.

That is the last of the news reports, now on with &quot;Those Amazing Acronyms...!&quot;

Name: Doom Prophet

FUCK-Facilities Utilization Control Kitchen.  A really hot office.  They keep
     backups of all systems per a LATA, or in special cases, the entire BOC
     area, along with user logs and passwords.  They use the CUNTLICK system
     to interface with SHIT, explained momentarily.  They are difficult to
     reach as no one knows their number, and anyone calling it has to enter a
     special queue dispenser where he enters routing information to reach the
     FUCK ACD.  The FUCK technicians answer as normal subscribers and you have
     to tell them a codeword.

PENIS-Plant Engineering Network Information System.  Used by the PMS to deal
      with outside plant details and layout maps.

CUNTLICK-Computer Utilities Network In the Control Kitchen.  Used to sensor

     society.  **Due to divestiture, NATE and STAN are no longer part of the
     network**

IL DUCE-Not an acronym, but the janitorial services department of the network.

LEX-Lengthy Explanatory Xlations.  This program, found alongside SCOOP,
    converts all lowercase text, from SCOOP, into upper case and 40 columns
