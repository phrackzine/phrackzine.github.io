MCI INTERNATIONAL
-----------------
MCI International provides private-line voice service to several overseas
countries, and data and message services, including telex, cablegram, leased
channel, and packet switching communications, to more than 200 overseas points.
MCI has moved into two new areas of service:  International direct-dial
telephone service and international electronic mail and hard-copy delivery
services.

International Record Services
-----------------------------
TELEX SERVICE (domestic and international) permits instantaneous, two-way,
written communications with other subscribers worldwide.  Customers can send
messages at any time, even though the receiving terminal may be unattended.
MCI International offers access to its telex service from a variety of
terminals and networks; not only subscribers with telex terminals but also
those with communicating word processors, data terminals or computers that
communicate over telephone lines can take advantage of MCI International telex
service.  To subscribers connected to its own telex network, MCI International
offers World Message Services--a package of communications offerings including
telex, cablegram and MCI Mail services.  Various service enhancements are
available to save time, improve operating efficiency and simplify records
keeping for telex users.

CABLEGRAM SERVICE, the traditional means of international written
communications, offers flexibility in delivery and economical rates for shorter
messages.  Cablegrams can be delivered to virtually any overseas point.
Subscribers with telex terminals or various other types of equipment can access
and TELUS cablegram switch and take advantage of such service enhancements as
abbreviated addressing and departmental billing.

LEASED CHANNEL SERVICE provides an exclusive line between a U.S. firm and it's
overseas office for private communications 24 hours a day.  Each MCI
International leased channel is tailored to meet the needs of a specific
customer for teleprinter, facsimile, voice and/or data traffic.  For
subscribers with several offices requiring private communications with each
other, MCI International offers a versatile message-switching service.
Voice/data leases can be configured to meet a whole array of communicating
needs; for example, one channel might carry data traffic from a computer at
night, voice communications during office hours, and simultaneous teleprinter
messages at any time.  Data channels can handle requirements for traffic at any
speed from 1200 bits per second to 1.544 megabits per second.

IMPACS SERVICE uses packet-switching technology to provide international
communications service between data terminals and computers.  Impacs offers
on-line, real-time connections and enables many types of incompatible systems
to communicate.  Impacs service offers virtually error-free transmission
because of the error-detection and retransmission capability of the network.

INSTALINK SERVICE allows businesses overseas to use regular telex equipment to
access remote computing systems and databases in the U.S.  Subscribers can
retrieve data from a computer-based information service or use a computing
system connecting to a packet-switching network in the U.S.

INTERNATIONAL FACSIMILE SERVICE enables subscribers to send duplicates of
original documents overseas quickly and efficiently, even when neither the
sender nor the receiver has facsimile transmission equipment, or when the
sender and receiver have incompatible equipment.

DATEL SERVICE provides automatic or voice-coordinated data transmission at
speeds up to 2400 bits per second.  Either digital or analog facsimile traffic
can be transmitted via Datel.  Datel facilities are conditioned to ensure
high-quality transmission.  The MCI International switching center allows
communications between incompatible terminals.

MARITIME SERVICES provide instant, high--quality contact between ships at sea
or offshore rigs, and between these vessels and land-based subscribers
worldwide.

International Voice Services
----------------------------
PRIVATE LINE SERVICE provides, fast, easy access to a single overseas location
at an economical monthly rate.  This technically efficient system maximizes the
use of line capacity by recognizing idle time and assigning a speaker to a
