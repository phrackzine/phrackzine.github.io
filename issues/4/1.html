         Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile I.  I started thinking about it and
personally had always been interested in people's backgrounds, especially those
who are around a lot, have been around for a long time, or are sysops.  This
new feature of Phrack Inc. will present info about various members of the
phreak/hack community ranging from personal to public.  This month's
interviewee....

                                 Crimson Death
                                 ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~

         Crimson Death is the sysop of Hell Phrozen Over, a private phreak/hack
bulletin board in Philadelphia, PA. (215).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal
~~~~~~~~
             Handle: Crimson Death
           Call him: Robb
       Past handles: The Sorcerer (before he was a phreak, a pirate handle)
      Handle origin: AD&amp;D Monster Manual II
      Date of Birth: February 17,
Age at current date: 16 years old
             Height: 5'3&quot;
             Weight: 110 lbs
          Eye color: Brown outlined with green
         Hair Color: Dark brown
           Computer: Apple //e with 10 meg hard drive
  Sysop/Co-Sysop of: Hell Phrozen Over, Missing Link, Skull Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Crimson Death started out in the BBS world in 1984 with a public
board, Spirit World, which was run on an Apple //e, 2 floppies, GBBS, and 300
baud.  He had originally gotten his Apple computer in January of 1984.  Then,
on one memorable day, The Videosmith logged onto his board and they became
friends.  In February of 1985, he started phreaking.  When his 10 meg Sider
came, he started Hell Phrozen Over as a private bulletin board system.  Death
called a few memorable boards, including the Army BBS, Shadowland, The Missing
Link, The Labyrinth, as well as his own.  His phreak teacher was The
Videosmith.

         Robb goes to a public school and has skipped a grade, so he is
currently one grade ahead of his time.  His phreaking is unknown at school
except to a few.  He considers himself pretty well versed in programming, and
from the way his board runs, I would agree.  CD's girlfriend is The Silver Fox,
(note the word &quot;Fox&quot;) that he met on Datanet, and popular opinion says she is
REALLY decent looking.

         Crimson Death does no hacking right now, but in the future when he
gets a bit of free time, he plans on learning about it.  Mentioned earlier was
his involvement in Phreak Klass 2600.  Red Devil has taken it down, and they
are looking for a replacement board, Phreak Klass II.  Death has met various
phreaks, old and new, and those of who really stuck out in his mind were: The
Videosmith, Mark Tabas, TUC, Telenet Bob, The Sprinter, and Dr. Who.  He listed
others too, but he felt that these were the &quot;mentionables&quot;.  Just thought I'd
let a few out there know.  Hell Phrozen Over is co-sysoped by Silicon Swindler,
and the Phreak Adviser is The Videosmith, a 300/1200 baud, 10 meg system.  He
was, in the past, in PhD, which stands for Phreak/Hack Destroyers.  This
eventually evolved into Camorra.  PhD was run by The Executioner (301), members
included Red Devil, Silver Sabre, and Scorpion among others.

         He is quite a comedian also, he wishes for all of you to have his last
name, address, and credit card number (heh heh).  The following are excerpts
from his Death Plan File, Inc. project.  I hope you find this phile
interesting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Interests: Krista, Computers (programming my BBS), telecommunications
                   (modeming, phreaking), reading books (Sci-Fi/Fantasy) and
                   magazines (movie mags, Psychology Today, Omni), movies
                   (circa 1930's to present), writing (short stories, raps,
                   poems for my girlfriend), music (listening (rap, rock,
                   jazz, some pop, classical, an occasional love song), playing
                   guitar and keyboard), origins/beliefs of religions (although
                   I am not religious at all), mysteries of the Universe, RPG's
                   (rare these days), the arts (painting/drawing/sketching,
                   music (as mentioned), art museums), trivia, parapsychology,
                   comedy.

Tabas with one leg over the balcony at The Palace
Being chased by a 6' 8&quot; homo at P-Con IV

Some People to Mention
----------------------

Schoolgirl  (the nicest person on Datanet [Hugs!])
The Heretic (Bizarre, but cool..)
The Warlock Lord (although we occasionally have our differences)
Dire Wraith (Hm. Not much to say)
Tuc (One of the coolest)
Capt. Zap (a pretty nice guy)
Bit Man (just learn to not talk so much!)
Blue Buccaneer (for all he has done (u/l, posts, etc), and being a cool guy)
Maxwell Smart &amp; The Baron (just cool people..)

People Crimson Death would like to say a few things to
------------------------------------------------------

Krista (the person I hold dearest to my heart, who I love and cherish even
        more-so than I do myself; and for being herself)

Silicon Swindler (For being my best friend for the past few years. I would
                  like to thank him for sticking with me through A LOT
                  of bad times)

The Videosmith (for introducing me the mystic world of phreaking, being my
                mentor in this &quot;mystic world&quot;, but most of all being a
                friend)

The Executioner (who can be an egotistical asshole at times, but showed
                 me he really does care at Phreak Con, when a 6' 8&quot;
                 ogre wanted my ass)

Red Devil (who has put up with all of my cut-ups and not kicked the
           shit out of me, even though he could. Sorry about that)

The People at Data-Tek (who put up Datanet in which without it, I would
                        have never met Krista)

Everyone Else who I didn't mention (for the one's who I know care; and
                                    the people who put up with my faults)

*TOTAL LOSERS*: The Sting (Otto) (414), Black Majik, Bloody Sabath.

The above three people have busted on me for having had an illness. In May, of
1983 I was struck with Leukemia, cancer of the blood. Luckily, I was cured
of this disease, and now lead a normal life. Yes, I was bald at one period of
time, but I am not now. Even so, that is nothing to bust on. I don't care
who it is, and what they have done to you, because busting on an illness is
is pure idiocy. No one understands...until they or someone they love is
struck.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you enjoyed this phile, look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming in
the near future.  Oh, and one last thing, I'm taking a poll from all
interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  Crimson Death says &quot;No&quot;.  Thanks for
your time Robb.
