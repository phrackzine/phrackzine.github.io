you for making this translation project something

Introduction phrack 56-1

The old anarchy with turtles/astral projection/home drug lab Phrack
articles make me want to rig some kind of testicle-electrocution apparatus
-- perhaps through the parallel port. I could make a winamp plugin so that
I get a painful shock to the balls every time the bass hits.

Phrack Loopback phrack 56-2

I eat meat, I tickle your feet, I ask for slashdot news it's neet,
but today i saw an fbi bird, it tried to eat my honey word.
Red worm ran, into the can, of win doze boxes, then sent some spam,
to see if they could pester the man, who tries to run our nationalized
land.
Read the posts, chase the ghosts, who penetrate our servers and hosts,
and you will come to learn to be, a non-elite computer hacker like me.
if you need help, send me mail, I will gladly flame your tail,
only after youve been inseminated, will my info be disseminated.
That is right, I make light, cuz i dont get none night to night,
but if a girl will come and get me laid, I'll make more funny for all to
read. :)

Project Loki: ICMP Tunneling phrack 49-6

I can't believe how old this article is!! Here it is July of 2001 and I'm
tracking this Loki down myself. I'm in Network IDS and very new to it, and
being told that this Loki icmp packet I see hitting our primary dns server
is &quot;normal network traffic&quot;. Only problem is that on the
outgoing side of the dns server, it's throwing port probes and packets like
there's not tommorrow. I'm thinking this has been converted to use UDP
packets and even port 53 to mask itself as actual usable traffic. I guess
it's time for me to pull the packets down and open each one. I pray to
find Loki active actually in the raw packet data so I can say &quot;ha
ha&quot; to my sys admins.

  [  You're *praying* to find Loki on your primary DNS server?  And here'z a
     crazy thought:  maybe that &quot;suspicious&quot; DNS traffic is... DNS traffic. ]

greets-
I want to congratulate you guys on kicking ass in the underground for
all these years.

    [  Thankz, but we're actually pretty new to thiz. ]

As wise old eze (could have) said &quot;motherfuck 2600,
motherfuck slashdot, motherfuck linux and let the real motha'fuckn' hackers
in!&quot; eheh.. [wtf?] Anyway, I wanted you to know that your logic has
probably helped out the underground a hell load then just making fun of the
people (which you do and is very fucking funny).

    [  I think you contradicted yourself there buddy. ]

I only wish your issues
would come out more often and every kid could read them as much as they
read their gpl'd slashdot/2600 &quot;i 0wn j00z everything&quot; fuqn' shit
articles. God, it'll be the day when the new generation of
&quot;hackers&quot; actually hack and not sit around mimicking your
tremendous journal (like b0g) or idle on irc all day and smurf anyone they
don't recognize.

    [  I think that day already arrived years ago. ]

Once again keep up the good work and keep the scene
alive.
