Subject: Loopback Correction

While scanning the loopback section of Issue 37, I came across this letter:


&gt;:: Fed Proof Your BBS, NOT! ::
&gt;
&gt;     I'm sure many of you have seen text files on making your BBS more secure.
&gt;One such file floating around is by Babbs Boy of Midnight Society.  One of the
&gt;members of our Phrack Staff showed this document to EFF's Mike Godwin, who is
&gt;an attorney.  He had the following comments:

&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
&gt;
&gt;From: Mike Godwin
&gt;To: Phrack Inc.
&gt;
&gt;(In regards to some of the files about how to &quot;fed-proof&quot; your BBS:)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Let's start with the log on screen:  If FEDZ want anything from your board,
&gt;&gt;  they are required to provide 100% accurate information.
&gt;
&gt;This is false.  Ask the legislators who've been convicted in &quot;sting&quot;
&gt;operations.  In fact, so far as I can tell in a brief run-through of this
&gt;document, absolutely no part of the so-called &quot;legal&quot; advice is true.
&gt;
&gt;Law enforcement agents who misrepresent their identities (e.g., &quot;undercover
&gt;agents&quot;) produce admissible evidence all the time.
&gt;
&gt;--Mike


Allow me to clear some things up.  Babbs' Boy was a friend of mine a while back
and was more of a Game Programmer than a &quot;hacker&quot; (or &quot;cracker,&quot; if you want
to be anal about it).  Babbs' Boy was NEVER in MsU.  He had asked me if he
could write a file for the group.  We informed him that he could if he wanted
to, but he could in no way represent us.  According to Babbs' Boy, he retrieved
the information from a copy of the ECPA.  Since we were not releasing that as a
MsU file, we never bothered to check any of the said information out.  In fact,
MsU does not create files for public display, although individual members may.

Apparently Babbs' Boy uploaded his copy of the document to Ripco, in which
it went wideband from there.  I am told that 3 other documents were released
in MSU's name, by someone using one of my very old handles of Raistlin.  I can
assure you that these documents were not released by any legitimate (old or
current) member of Midnight Society Underground.

Again, to clear things up, Babbs' is not nor ever was a member of MsU, nor
are there any legitimate public releases from our group.

Besides, we don't let people in the group who spell Feds &quot;FEDZ&quot; ..the shit just
ain't done.

Subject: Censorship in Cyberspace
To: Phrack Staff

I have been hired to write an article about the control of information in
cyberspace.  We all know that Fidonet moderators and sysops devote their OWN
resources for us to use.  There is no question about the &quot;right&quot; of the sysop
or moderator to delete messages and users.  The practice of censorship is
nonetheless newsworthy.

If YOU have experienced censorship on Fidonet or Usenet, Prodigy or CompuServe,
or another BBS or network, I am interested in learning about your story.  If
you can supply downloads of actual encounters, so much the better.

If you have ever been censored, send me physical world mail about the event.

Dear Phrack Staff,

There are very serious negative consequences surrounding the use of modems
and computers in our society.  Because of this, all children under the age
of 18 should be prohibited from using a computer in connection with a modem
or that is connected to any computer service.

Please read my attached news release and join me in spreading this message.

-- Ron Hults

NEWS RELEASE                                                     March 18, 1992


PEDOPHILIA, COMPUTERS, AND CHILDREN

If you have children in your home and a home computer complete with a telephone
modem, your child is in potential danger of coming in contact with deviant and
dangerous criminals.

Using the computer modem, these unsavory individuals can communicate directly
with your child without your knowledge.  Just as importantly, you should be
concerned if your child has a friendship with other youth who has access to
this equipment in an unsupervised environment.

Using a computer and a modem, your child can readily access community &quot;bulletin
boards&quot; and receive sexually explicit and graphic material from total strangers
who can converse with your children, individuals you quite probably wouldn't
even talk with.

The concern becomes more poignant when stated otherwise; would you let a child
molester, murderer, or convicted criminal into your home to meet alone with
your child?

According to Fresno Police Detective Frank Clark, &quot;your child can be in real
danger from pedophiles, rapists, satanic cultists and other criminals known to
be actively engaged in computer conversation.  Unwittingly, naive children with
a natural curiosity can be victimized; emerging healthy sexual feelings of a
child can be subverted into a twisted, unnatural fetish affecting youth during
a vulnerable time in their lives.&quot;

It is anticipated that parents, when armed with the knowledge that this
activity exists and awareness that encounters with such deviant individuals
can result in emotional and psychological damage to their child, will take
appropriate measures to eliminate the possibility of strangers interacting with
their children via a computer.

Subject: Thanks

Dear Knight Lightning,

I would like to thank you for the message you wrote to Dale (scumbag) Drew.
Although the fact is that he will only be slightly inconvenienced by having to
dig up issues of Phrack on his own instead of having them delivered to his
mailbox, his being refused to be added to the mailing list means a lot more. If
I were him, I would consider it a slap in the face (since it seems almost as
bad, IMO, as being blacklisted).  :)

May he run into 10 homosexual wrestlers in a dark alley.

 Review of Intertek Winter 1992

 by Dispater

     Intertek is the *SHARPEST* looking 'zine I've seen yet that directly
addresses the world of cyberspace.  It's not &quot;high res&quot; color or artsy-fartsy
like Mondo 2000, but it is at least more interesting to read as a whole.  I
think it looks better and is more direct and to the point.  You don't have to
wade through a bunch of trash to get to something interresting.

     This issue of Intertek focused on &quot;virtual communities.&quot;  The topics
included:  &quot;Bury USENET,&quot; &quot;Electropolis (IRC),&quot; &quot;Social Organization of the
Computer Underground&quot; by Gordon Meyer, &quot;Real World Kerberos,&quot; and &quot;Mudding:
Social Phenomena in Text-Based Virtual Realities.&quot;  Every issue also contains
the top news tidbits about some truly high-tech achievements that go unnoticed
by the mainstream media (I guess the Mike Tyson trial gets more ratings,
huh?).  All in all, it was much more interesting to me than the last issue
(Volume 3.2).  It's magazines like this that I hope will help make the
mainstream media obsolete.

     If you are looking for &quot;how-to&quot; techie projects or hacking tips, this is
NOT for you!  Many hackers I know don't like it and think it's boring as hell;
2600 and Phrack it isn't.  However, if you are interested in the &quot;big picture&quot;
of the cyberspace (what ever that means! :) or are, say, interested in studying
cyberspace from an uninvolved level, this is the magazine for you. Intertek is
full of social insight into what makes the cyberspace tick.  It does this much
better than the feeble attempts other magazines have made.  For only $7.00 a
year, I think it's worth it.

 Hacking in Australia
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 By The Cure

Australia has been very sparse after my BBS (Micromation) was closed down.  A
lot of people took it as a warning, and closed up shop as well.  The Amiga
warez BBSes still continue to flourish, as do some IBM ones.  Because of the
expense of phone lines ($300 installation of a line, $250 per year rental [in
American dollars]) we tend to have a lot of BBSes that are dual purpose, i.e.
both warez and phreak.  Devastation Phase One is a great example:  huge Amiga/
IBM/phreak/etc.  I, however, was devoted to phreak/hack/etc.  We did have a few
busts actually, and the police were called in to trace all calls through Vicnet
and some people I know were caught.  We've got a few warez-monger type people
here that have been busted for &quot;pitting&quot; (climbing into telecom phone pits, and
hooking up straight to the lines) - and I had my knuckles rapped by my
university.  Phoenix's court case still hasn't been settled (he's had 35 of the
47 charges against him dropped).  Comserve has finally made it down under, and
they're footing the bill for the first year, allowing us to be on Comserve in
the States for a while.  Our telephone company (Telecom) is a government
monopoly, and we've only just passed legislation to allow competition.  The
first carrier allowed will be a company called Optus.  Call waiting,
conferencing, etc. is almost standard here now.

 Censorship in Iowa
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From:  Mike Begley &lt;spam@iastate.edu&gt;

Hi.  I got your name from Erik Bloodaxe. He said you might be able to help us
out with a minor problem we're having here.  The computation center at Iowa
State University will very soon institute a policy of censorship of a number of
groups of questionable nature, specifically the alt.sex hierarchy, alt.drugs,
and a few other similar groups.

I wish to conduct a survey of the users of our computer system, but the
university specificly prohibits mass mailings.

I'm frightened by censorship, and I want to fight this as best I can.  If you
would be able to do this favor for us, you would be helping to fight electronic
censorship and suppression of free expression.
