     Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile.  Phrack Pro-Phile is created to bring info to
you, the users, about old or highly important/controversial people.  This
month, I bring to you the original of the controversial New TAP Magazine.

                                   Aristotle

                      care to mention.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     I was one of those people that played with phones for as long as I can
remember.  I guess you could say I started phreaking a few years before
WARGAMES came out.  After the movie, I found out that other people were
interested in phones too.  Due to the influx of &quot;elite hackers&quot; after the
movie, information became extrememly available.  This lead to my existence in
the real world of hack/phreak.

     Eventually I ended up writing articles for both 2600 and TAP.  In the late
80s I restarted TAP with help from some friends and we started to revive one
of the first hack/phreak magzines that ever existed.

     Having TAP helped us gain a special insight on how the system really
works.  Some of our issues were cool enough to actually be censored at certain
institutions where avid censorship still exists.  Also, we were allowed to see
how far you could go in expressing your opinion until some bigshot noticed.

     Believe it or not though, running a periodical without any income is a
major pain.  It was well worth it though as I got to meet a lot of cool people
and also was able to do something for the computer underground scene.  If you
currently don't support magazines like 2600, etc., please do.  They are doing a
lot of work for the community and without them, there would be a major gap in
the press regarding the truth about our community.

     I exited the hack/phreak world when things got a bit hairy and Craig
(Knight Lightning) got nailed.  I simply decided that a hobby is not worth
going to jail for and that it did not pay the bills either.  Anyways, most old
hacks eventually reach the point where everything they see seems old and
boring.  This is where I currently am.

     Today I am employed at a computer lab at a large university where I am
working on a degree.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?

     Of the general population, I would consider about 89.9% to be nerds.  I
would also consider 65% of the entire population nerds and/or strange.  Phreaks
may be geeks but each usually has his/her cool qualities as everyone does.
Most are socially lacking though.  Keep in mind that a hacker/phreak is ALWAYS
better than the average GIF viewing geek.
