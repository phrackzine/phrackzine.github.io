I am new to the world of hacking and cracking, and I want to get some info

What I want to do is, obtain credit card numbers, get email passwords and
get into NASA and the FBI, if I am lucky.  The sort of stuff the movie

someone email me the information or point me into the right direction on

    recommend watching Hackers a few more times and then getting yourself
    some Gibsons.  Remember -- the most commonly used passwords are &quot;love&quot;,

Hey again Phrack

  [ Hello ]

I have now read quite a few of your magazines. BUT there is a pretty
nasty failure in number 56... Either the index file is misplaced or the
articles are. They don't match, that's for sure!

  [ It is all fine.  It is indexed in hex (the index file is quite clear if
    you bother to read it -- p56-0x01) ]

If you have gotten the time for it could you then please fix it. And I
would be happy if you would send me a copy of the correct one when
finished..

  [ No.  It's not broken, chump. ]

Thank you.

Subject: [phrackstaff] Best wishes

Greetings guys (and gals?),

  [ Greetings, I. O. ]

        First things first: Phrack is a really good e-zine, and loopback is
just great, but you knew this already ;)

  [ Of course! ]

I'm an aspiring hacker and all-round geek. Girls are scarce over here;
knowledge even more so. I developed the hacker state of mind when I was
exposed to the Net, while I was studying like a demon for a competition
which landed me my Celeron (with some peripherals). While surfing two
days ago, I stumbled onto phrack.org and an old flame was rekindled; So
here I am...
        Really guys, Phrack is a good thing. Keep up the good work. The
home page is very nice too... Maybe even chicks will dig it ;)

  [ The webmaster has been hoping they would since day 1. ]

        I'm a pretty good C and C++ programmer, and the only difficulty I
have is money. NO credit cards to pay for books I can buy only online. I'd 
be very grateful if anyone over there could give me the location of a
_free_ machine-readable copy of &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; by K&amp;R. I
doubt if even the universities over here have it (off the record, some
professors here don't know that printf(...) actually returns something, but
claim to have written Linux kernel modules :| ).

  [ If you're a pretty good C programmer, why do you need that particular
    book?  Are you lying to us?  Try a library. ]

        Anyway, thanks, and I can say with absolute, nay, non-relative
certainty that the number of Phrack readers has increased by one
non-atomically.

  [ Geek! ]

PS: if the only &quot;alvin&quot; you can recall is alvin of the chipmunks, read

Hello, to whom it may concern;

When I went to your 'download' link it opened in 'edit' mode..
showing me the total &gt;&gt; Index of /archives&gt;&gt; without the HTML.

  [ Really?  That's disgraceful! ]

Found your site while searching Yahoo on how to play a video file I
downloaded with an .AVI extension with a comment &quot; EG-VCD&quot; after the name
of file, which causes my Windows Media Player to play only the sound ..
without the video.

  [ Interesting. ]

Thus I was looking for a player/codec to solve this problem.

  [ Good luck. ]

Any suggestions are appreciated.

  [ I'm all out of ideas. ]

Your site has been added to my favorites. I truly enjoy your content.
Congratulations.

i used to have it but my hard drive fried and i thought it was gone             
forever.....                                                                  

    [ Man, I've been looking for that one for the last 15 years
      on www.phrack.org but i guess one of the previous editors just
      rm'ed it. jolly rodger cook book, yummm yumm, that's what's
      missing on our page....]

How do I figure out someone's password and user name if I have their e-mail
address?

    [ The easiest way is just to ask him:
      echo &quot;ALL UR PASSW0RDZ R BEL0NG TO US!&quot; | mail target@hotmail.com ]
