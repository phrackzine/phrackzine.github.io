Prologue For None VMS Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     DECnet is the network for DEC machines, in most cases you can say VAXes.
DECnet allows you to do:   - e-mail
                           - file transfer
                           - remote login
                           - remote command
                           - remote job entry
                           - PHONE
     PHONE is an interactive communication between users and is equal to TALK
on UNIX or a &quot;deluxe&quot;-CHAT on VM/CMS.

     BELWUE, the university network of the state Baden-Wuerttemberg in
West Germany contains (besides other networks) a DECnet with about 400 VAXes.
On every VAX there is standard-account called DECNET with pw:= DECNET, which is
not reachable via remote login.  This account is provided for several
DECnet-Utilities and as a pseudo-guest-account.  The DECNET-account has very
restricted privileges:  You cannot edit a file or make another remote login.

    The HELP-menu is equipped by the system and is similar to the MAN command
on UNIX.

    More information on DECnet can be found in &quot;Looking Around In DECnet&quot; by
Deep Thought in this very issue of Phrack Inc.

     Here, at the University of Ulm, we have an *incredibly* ignorant computer
center staff, with an even bigger lack of system-literature (besides the 80 kg
of VAX/VMS-manuals).  The active may search for information by himself, which
is over the level of &quot;run,&quot; &quot;FORTRAN,&quot; or &quot;logout.&quot;  My good luck that I have
other accounts in the BELWUE-DECnet, where more information is offered for the
users.  I am a regular student in Ulm and all my accounts are completely legal
and corresponding to the German laws.  I don't call myself a &quot;hacker,&quot; I feel
more like a &quot;user&quot; (...it's more a defining-problem).

     In the HELP-menu in a host in Tuebingen I found the file netdcl.com and
the corresponding explanation, which sends commands to the DECNET-Account of
other VAXes and executes them there (remote command).  The explanation in the
HELP-menu was idiot-proof -- therefore for me, too :-)

     With the command &quot;$ mcr ncp show known nodes&quot; you can obtain a list of all
netwide active VAXes, as is generally known, and so I pinged all these VAXes to
look for more information for a knowledge-thirsty user.  With &quot;help&quot;, &quot;dir&quot; and
other similar commands I look around on those DECnet accounts, always watching
for topics related to the BELWUE-network.  It's a pity, that 2/3 of all VAXes
have locked the DECNET-Account for NETDCL.COM.  Their system managers are
probably afraid of unauthorized access, but I cannot imagine how there could be
such an unauthorized access, because you cannot log on this account -- no
chance for trojan horses, etc.

     Some system managers called me back after I visited their VAX to chat with
me about the network and asked me if they could help me in any way. One sysop
from Stuttgart even sent me a version of NETDCL.COM for the ULTRIX operation
system.

     Then, after a month, the  H O R R O R  came over me in shape of a the
following mail:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM       31-MAY-1989 15:31:11.38
To:     FRAMSTAG
CC:
Subj:   don't make any crap, or you'll be kicked out!

From:   ITTGPX::SYSTEM       29-MAY-1989 16:46
To:     TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM
Subj:   System-breaking-in 01-May-1989

To the system manager of the Computer TUEBINGEN,

On May 1st 1989 we had a System-breaking-in in our DECNET-account, which
started from your machine.  By help of our accounting we ascertained your user
FRAMSTAG to have emulated an interactive log-on on our backbone-node and on
every machine of our VAX-cluster with the &quot;trojan horse&quot; NETDCL.COM.  Give us
this user's name and address and dear up the occurrence completely.  We point
out that the user is punishable.  In case of repetition we would be forced to
take corresponding measures.  We will check whether our system got injured.  If
not, this time we will disregard any measure.  Inform us via DECnet about your
investigation results -- we are attainable by the nodenumber 1084::system

Dipl.-Ing. Michael Hager
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     My system manager threatened me with the deleting of my account, if I
would not immediately enlighten the affair.  *Gulp*!
     I was conscious about my innocence, but how to tell it to the others?  I
explained, step by step, everything to my system manager.  He then understood
after a while, but the criminal procedure still hovered over me... so, I took
quickly to my keyboard, to compose file of explanations and to send it to that
angry system manager in Stuttgart (node 1084 is an institute there).  But no
way out:  He had run out of disk quota and my explanation-mail sailed into the
nirwana:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
$ mail explanation
  To:   1084::system
%MAIL-E, error sending to user SYSTEM at 1084
%MAIL-E-OPENOUT, error opening SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]MAIL$00040092594FD194.MAI;
as output
-RMS-E-CRE, ACP file create failed
-SYSTEM-F-EXDISKQUOTA, disk quota exceeded
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     Also the attempt of a connection with the PHONE-facilty failed:  In his
borderless hacker-paranoia, he cut off his PHONE... and nowhere is a list with
the REAL-addresses of the virtual DECnet-addresses available (to prevent
hacking).  Now I stood there with the brand &quot;DANGEROUS HACKER!&quot; and I had no
chance to vindicate myself.  I poured out my troubles to an acquaintance of
mine, who is a sysop in the computer-center in Freiburg.  He asked other sysops
and managers thru the whole BELWUE-network until someone gave him a telephone
number after a few days -- and that was the right one!

     I phoned to this Hager and told him what I had done with his
DECnet-account and also what NOT.  I wanted to know which crime I had
committed.  He promptly cancelled all of his reproaches, but he did not excuse
his defamous incriminations.  I entreated him to inform my system manager in
Tuebingen that I have done nothing illegal and to stop him from erasing my
account.  This happens already to a fellow student of mine (in this case, Hager
was also guilty).  He promised me that he would officially cancel his
reproaches.

     After over a week this doesn't happen (I'm allowed to use my account
further on).  In return for it, I received a new mail from Hager on another
account of mine:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   1084::HAGER         1-JUN-1989 12:51
To:     50180::STUD_11
Subj:   System-breaking-in

On June 1st 1989 you have committed a system-breaking-in on at least one of our
VAXes.  We were able to register this occurrence.  We would be forced to take
further measure if you did not dear up the occurrence completely until June
6th.

Of course the expenses involved would be imposed on you.  Hence enlightenment
must be in your own interest.

We are attainable via DECnet-mail with the address 1084::HAGER or via following
address:

Institut fuer Technische Thermodynamik und Thermische Verfahrenstechnik
Dipl.-Ing. M. Hager    Tel.: 0711/685-6109
Dipl.-Ing. M. Mrzyglod Tel.: 0711/685-3398
Pfaffenwaldring 9/10-1
7000 Stuttgart-80

This was the reaction of my attempt: &quot;$ PHONE 1084::SYSTEM&quot;.  I have not
answered to this mail.  I AM SICK OF IT!
