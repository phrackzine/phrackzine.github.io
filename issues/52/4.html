		    * Salespeople

            
----------------[  Passions
    
- Business (penetration testing / security auditing).  
- Tropical places (relaxation).  
- Urban places (excitement).  
- Winky, the magic dog, mule, hare catcher.  
- Computers / networking. 
- My girlfriend. 
- Europe in general (but honestly, if you are Dutch and you own a restaurant, 
  come to the US, and learn about ground beef.  Also, figure out what &quot;well 
  done&quot; means.  Honestly though, I must compliment you on your excellent 
  selection of various strains of marijuana).


----------------[  Memorable experiences

- Owning switches over the Internet (TCP --&gt; X.25).
- Owning my first nice car.
- Owning your machine.
- Getting punched by a large Sicilian, and getting knocked out.
- Putting a large Sicilian in the hospital.

   
----------------[  People to mention

- Joan Croc, for all of the millions of dollars she never gave me.
- Daemon9, for patting me on the back and breaking my spine by accident.
- My girlfriend, for being the awesome girl next door.
- Her parents, for feeding me all the time.
- Tattoo, my puppy ... for pissing on my bed, my floor, and all my clothes.
- Everyone who has ever served me coffee.
- Everyone who has ever betrayed me. Thanks so much for your warmth and 
  compassion.
- Mr Rogers.  Using drugs to teach America's youth the moral responsibilities 
  they should adopt for their upcoming, bright futures, and using puppets to 
  illustrate the values of a smoothly flowing dictatorship.
- My parents, for tolerating all the weird phone calls from the rest of you 
  fuckers for many years, and for motivating me to learn about things I was 
  interested in by telling me that I would never get a job if I didn't go to
  college.  Heck, at least I didn't buy a degree out of a magazine, and end up 
  President of the United States. 
- Oprah, for providing me with entertainment while I watched you expand and
  contract like a blowfish.  (I don't think she reads this anyway) (But if I'm
  wrong, and Oprah is an avid phrack reader, then by all means .. sorry , it 
  was only a joke...  Besides, according to MiB, you're an alien).


----------------[  Pearls Of Wisdom

- Don't take any wooden nickels, but if you do, make sure you get enough to 
  build a log cabin.  Don't take any log cabins, but of you do, cut them up 
  small enough that you can give alot of people wooden nickels.
- Don't make up any cliches, but if you do, make sure they're funny.
- Make your business work for you, don't work for your business.
- Never ignore the ones you love.
- Buy quality merchandise for your home the first time around... unless you
  have roommates.
- If everyone else around you gets caught, its time to stop.
- If a speaker is a speaker, and not a &quot;sound emissions device&quot;, then is
  toilet paper &quot;toilet paper&quot;, or &quot;Butt Wiping Cloth?&quot;
- Eat out alot, unless she tells you to stop.
- All the people who consistently come on irc and ask &quot;teach me how to hack&quot;,
  first of all, most of the people on irc understand English as well as its 
  associated rules of grammar.  Second, pick up a fricking book once in a 
  while and you might actually be surprised at what you are capable of. We're 
  supposed to be evolving, remember?
- When I was a young boy, I ate a snail.  If you are a young boy, don't.
- If you beat the shit out of someone, make sure its not in front of my house, 
  because I don't want to clean up all that shit.
