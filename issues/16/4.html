Hacking the Global Telecommunications Network
Researched and written by:  The Kurgan
Compiled on 10/5/87


Network Procedure Differences

The Global Telecommunications Network (GTN) is Citibanks's international data
network, which allows Citicorp customers and personnel to access Citibank's
worldwide computerized services.

Two different sign on procedures exist: Type A and Type B.  All users, except
some  in  the U.S., must use Type B.  (U.S. users: the number  you dial into
and  the  Welcome  Banner  you	receive	determine  what  sign-on procedure to
follow.)  Welcome banners are as follows:

TYPE A:
WELCOME TO CITIBANK. PLEASE SIGN ON.
XXXXXXXX

@
PASSWORD =

@

TYPE B:
PLEASE ENTER YOUR ID:-1-&gt;
PLEASE ENTER YOUR PASSWORD:-2-&gt;

CITICORP (CITY NAME). KEY GHELP FOR HELP.
  XXX.XXX
 PLEASE SELECT SERVICE REQUIRED.-3-&gt;


Type A User Commands

User commands are either instructions or information you send to the network
for it to follow.  The commands available are listed below.

User Action:  Purpose:

@ (CR)	To put you in command mode (mode in which you can put
	 your currently active service on hold and ask the network
	 for information, or log-off the service).  (NOTE: This
	 symbol also serves as the network prompt; see Type A
	 messages.)

BYE (CR)  To leave service from command mode.

Continue (CR)  To return to application from command mode (off hold)

D (CR)			To leave service from command mode.

ID			To be recognized as a user by the network (beginning of
			sign on procedure), type ID, then a space and your
			assigned network ID.  (Usually 5 or 6 characters long)

Status (CR)		To see a listing of network address (only from @
			prompt).  You need this address when &quot;reporting a
			problem.&quot;

Type A messages

The network displays a variety of messages on your screen which either require
a user command or provide you with information.

Screen shows:  Explanation:

@   Network prompt -- request for Network ID.

BAD PASSWORD  Network does not except your password.

&lt;address&gt; BUSY		The address is busy, try back later.


WELCOME TO CITIBANK.	Network welcome banner.	Second line provides address
PLEASE SIGN ON.		# to be used when reporting &quot;problems.&quot;
XXX.XXX

&lt;address&gt; ILLEGAL	You typed in an address that doesn't exist.

&lt;address&gt; CONNECTED	Your connection has been established.

DISCONNECTED		Your connect has been disconnected.

NOT CONNECTED		You're not connected to any service at the time.

NUI REQUIRED		Enter your network user ID.

PASSWORD =		Request for your assigned password.

STILL CONNECTED		You are still connected to the service you were using.

?			Network doesn't understand your entry.


Type B User Commands and Messages

Since the Type B procedure is used with GTN dial-ups, it requires fewer
commands to control the network.  There is only 1 Type B command.  Break plus
(CR) allows you to retain connection to one service, and connect with another.


Screen Shows:  Explanation:

CITICORP (CITY NAME).	Network Welcome banner.	Type in service address.
 PLEASE SELECT SERVICE

COM   Connection made.

DER   The port is closed out of order, or no open routes are
      available.

DISCONNECTED  You have disconnected from the service and the network.

ERR   Error in service selected.

INV   Error in system.

MOM   Wait, the connection is being made.

NA    Not authorized for this service.

NC    Circuits busy, try again.

NP    Check service address.

OCC   Service busy, try again.


Sign-on Procedures:

  There are two types of sign on procedures.  Type A and Type B.


Type A:

To log onto a system with type A logon procedure, the easiest way is through
Telenet.  Dial your local Telenet port.	When you receive the &quot;@&quot; prompt, type
in the Type-A service address (found later in the article) then follow the
instructions from there on.

  Type-B:
    Dial the your GTN telephone #, then hit return twice.  You will then see:

&quot;PLEASE ENTER YOUR ID:-1-&gt;&quot;

Type in a network ID number and hit return.

    You will then see

&quot;PLEASE ENTER YOUR PASSWORD:-2-&gt;&quot;

     Type in Network Password and hit return.

    Finally you will see the &quot;CITICORP (city name)&quot; welcome banner, and it
will ask you to select the service you wish to log onto.  Type the address and
hit return.  (A list of addresses will be provided later)

Trouble Shooting:

    If you should run into any problems, the Citicorp personnel will gladly
help their &quot;employees&quot; with any questions.  Just pretend you work for Citibank
and they will give you a lot.  This has been tried and tested.	Many times,
when you attempt to log on to a system and you make a mistake with the
password, the system will give you a number to call for help.  Call it and
tell them that you forgot your pass or something.  It usually works, since
they don't expect people to be lying to them.  If you have any questions about
the network itself, call 305-975-5223.	It is the Technical Operations Center
(TOC) in Pompano, Florida.

Dial-Ups:

    The following list of dial-ups is for North America.  I have a list of
others, but I don't think that they would be required by anyone.  Remember:
Dial-ups require Type-B log-on procedure.  Type-A is available on systems
accessible through Telenet.

Canada Toronto	416-947-2992     (1200 Baud V.22 Modem Standard)
U.S.A. Los Angeles   213-629-4025     (300/1200 Baud U.S.A. Modem Standard)
       Jersey City   201-798-8500
       New York City 212-269-1274
		     212-809-1164

Service Addresses:

     The following is a VERY short list of just some of the 100's of service
addresses.  In a later issue I will publish a complete list.

Application Name:   Type-A  Type-B

CITIADVICE    2240001600 CADV
