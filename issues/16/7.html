-			  The Disk Jockey			     -
-			     presents:				-
-								      -
-		     Reading Trans-Union Reports:		     -
-			A lesson in terms used			 -
-			(A 2af presentation)			  -
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is dedicated to all the phreaks/hacks that were busted in the summer
of 1987, perhaps one of the most crippling summers ever for us.

Preface:
-------
     Trans-Union is a credit service much like CBI, TRW or Chilton, but offers
more competitive rates, and is being used more and more by many credit
checking agencies.

Logging in:
----------
     Call one of the Trans Union dial-ups at 300,E,7,1, Half Duplex. Such a
dial-up is 314-XXX-XXXX.  After connecting, hit Ctrl-S.	The system will echo
back a 'GO ' and then awaits you to begin the procedure of entering the
account and  password, then  mode, i.e.:  S F1111,111,H,T.   The system	will
then  tell  you	what  database	you  are  logged  on  to,  which  is	mostly
insignificant  for your use.  To  then pull  a	report,	you  would  type  the
following:  P JONES,JIM* 2600,STREET,CHICAGO,IL,60604** &lt;Ctrl-S&gt;.   The name
is  Jim Jones, 2600 is his street address, street is the  street name, Chicago
is the city, IL is the state, 60604 is the zip.

The Report:
----------
     The report will come out, and will look rather odd, with all types of
notation.  An example of a Visa card would be:

SUB NAME/ACCT#	SUB#	OPEND	HICR DTRP/TERM BAL/MAX.DEL PAY.PAT   MOP

CITIBANK	 B453411  3/87	$1000	9/87A	$0	 12111     R01
4128XXXXXXXXX		$1500		5/87	$120


Ok, Citibank is the issuing bank.  B453411 is their subscriber code.  3/87 is
when the account was opened.  HICR is the most that has been spent on that
card.  9/87 is when the report was last updated (usually monthly if active).
$1000 is the credit line.  $0 is the current balance.  12111 is the payment
pattern, where 1=pays in 30 days and 2=pays in 60 days. R01 means that it is a
&quot;Revolving&quot; account, meaning that he can make payments rather than pay the
entire bill at once.  4128-etc is his account number (card number).  $1500 is
his credit line.  5/87 is when he was late on a payment last.  $120 is the
amount that he was late with.

Here is a list of terms that will help you identify and understand the reports
better:
