Happy Birthday to Phrack, Happy Birthday to Phrack, Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday to Phrack.  November 17th, 1993 marks
the eighth year of Phrack Magazine.  Amazing, ain't it?  Seems like
only a few years.  Makes me feel old.  Damn.

I have been a busy boy since I put out 43.  I've been to Boston,
Amsterdam, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, and numerous points in between.
I've been slaving at the day job, consulting and speaking about
security on the side, working on other ventures you could not
possibly conceive of without proper initiation, and piecing together
this magazine.  (Listening for applause)

It's a big pain in the butt to do a magazine like this, especially
when people who SAY they are going to write something, don't.  I know,
it's a typical hacker cop-out to start something and then get
side-tracked by other projects.  I'm as guilty of that as is any of
you, but I'm trying to get better.  So should those of you who are
hiding your faces in shame...you know who you are.

Every day I get bombarded with &quot;When's the next Phrack coming out?&quot;
It started the day I released 43 on IRC.  THE SAME DAY!  43 hadn't even
gone out over the mailing list yet, and people were already asking
when the next one was due out!  I know they didn't read all 1.2
megs of 43 before they started in on me.  Geez, that gets old.
For those of you who ever consider asking me such a thing, the answer
is, &quot;When it's done.&quot;

Alas, still no new corporate registrations.  A few people
have expressed an interest, but never followed through.
We have gotten a number of non-corporate registrations from
people who I guess just wanted to send me mail.  Listen
guys, I love to hear from you all, but unless you are a corporate,
federal, or law enforcement reader complying with our registration
requirements and paying the fee, you don't have to send in the form.

We've got a few nifty things in this issue.  Phrack never really
included much more than text.  Last month's inclusion of the Novell
utilities uuencoded was a departure from the norm, and I decided to
do somthing like that again.  In this issue you will find a small
photo collection that might make you smile.

If you can't figure out how to use uudecode, I suggest
you close this file, and spend a few moments perusing the man page
entries on that command, or consulting a good book on unix.  And
for you whiners that don't have accounts on UNIX boxes, uuencode
and uudecode programs are available for DOS, Mac, Amiga and
virtually any platform you care to use.  (Although if you are using
MVS, CICS, TSO or 400/OS, you reap what you sow.)

A lot of conferences went on during the time that has passed since our
last issue.  It's nice to see that the community is making itself
a louder voice in the world, although seeing the word &quot;Cyber&quot; on
nearly every magazine in the Western Hemisphere is making me
rather nauseous, and if Billy Idol gets on another TV show (aside from
The Hollywood Squares, which would mean his career was OVER)
I may have to sell everything electronic I own.  Hell, there
was even hacking on Melrose Place.  Anyway, back to the point, as is
the case with every gathering, we've got it covered.

You might notice that there are a lot of files dealing with people
and places rather than strictly items of hardcore technical info.
I know some may disagree with me, but I really feel that its
important to document and chronicle things that relate to the
personalities of this community.  I mean, how entertaining is it
to read &quot;HOW TO HACK TOPS-20&quot; ten years later?

Don't get me wrong and think we're not dealing with anything meaty.
This issue we've also got operating system guides, cell &amp; bell stuff,
Van Eck info, and MORE MORE MORE.

Phrack 44.  It's out.  Now leave me alone.  :)
